<pre>
enum <b>CATCommandMode</b> {

<b><i> Command start mode.</i></b><br>

 <dl>
  <dt> <b>Values:</b>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt> CATCommandModeShared</tt>
   <dd>   The shared mode. The command is known by the command selector.
   As soon as the command is selected, the command selector
   deactivates the previous active command, that is, withdraws
   the focus and puts it into the command stack from where it can be
   reactivated later on,
   and gives the focus to the selected command to make
   it the active one.
 </dd>
    <dt><tt> CATCommandModeExclusive</tt>
   <dd>   The exclusive mode. The command is known by the command selector.
   As soon as the command is selected, the command selector
   deletes the previous active command
   and gives the focus to the selected command to make
   it the active one.
 </dd>
    <dt><tt> CATCommandModeUndefined</tt>
   <dd>   The undefined mode. The command is ignored by the command selector.
   It cannot be deleted or deactivated if another command is selected
   while it runs, and it runs until it completes.</dd>

<h3><a name="is"></a>What Is a Shape/Wireframe Feature?</h3>
<p>The GSMInterfaces Framework exports some capability to create Shape/Wireframe
Feature such as Points, Lines, Sweep, Extrapolation...<br>
Those Objects are Geometrical Features (or Procedures) that have additional
properties compare to Geometrical Objects like CATPoint, CATLine, CATPlane, etc.</p>
<p>A Feature is a Specification that embeds other Features or refers to other
Specification. The user can build a net of Specifications that describes the
relation between the different Features. Those relations are dependancies
relations, that are modellized to enable a <a href="#Update">General Update
Capability</a> shared by all CATIA V5 features. Other responsabilites of a
Feature are the capability to be <a href="#Edit">edited</a>, <a href="#CCP">duplicated</a>,
<a href="#Replace">replaced</a>, <a href="#Remove">removed</a> and <a href="#Isolate">isolated</a>.</p>
<p>Those Wireframe and Skin Features are Features and use several foundations
from CATIA V5 such as <a href="#Generic">Generic Naming Technology</a>, <a href="#Topology">Topological
Modeler</a>, Geometrical Modeler.</p>
<p>Every basic Wireframe Feature is defined as a subtype of a <a href="#Multi">Multitype
Feature</a> (e.g. PointOnCurve is a subtype of Point Feature) and any
Shape/Wireframe have to be created in a <a href="#Federator">Federating Feature</a>
called an Open Body. This last point is explained in two differentuse cases that
illustrate how to create an Open Body [<a href="#References">1</a>], and how to
insert a feature in the procedural view.[<a href="#References">2</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="dowith"></a>What Can I Do with a Shape/Wireframe Features?</h3>
<p>There is common capabilies shared by either V5 features or by Shape/Design
features. As we saw above, Shape/Wireframe features can share specification by
referring to other features (it can be in another Open Body, another document or
it can be a Face of a Solid Feature).</p>
<p>The Shape/Wireframe features set form a kind of net than is better
represented in the Part Editor Viewer. In this editor, you will see the
different links between Features that you can't see in the linear tree editor.</p>
<p>Besides, here are the main capability common to Shape/Wireframe features.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Update"></a>General Update Capability</h5>
<p>The CATIA V5 architecture offers a common procedural infrastructure for all
applications. This infrastructure picks up and manage the input/output [<a href="#References">3</a>]
dependencies between the specifications which are evaluated and computed one
after the others in a compatible order according to their dependencies.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="CCP"></a>Cut/Copy/Paste Capability</h5>
<p>Every CATIA V5 has the capability to be copied/cut and pasted in another
location. In that case, the default behavior is to keep the reference the
feature has before being copied and it duplicates with itself the components it
has. In order to change the reference the copy has, you have to edit the feature
copy and re-valuate the input specifications it has.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Replace"></a>Replace Capability</h5>
<p>Every CATIA V5 feature has the capability to be replaced by another one. It
has for effect, that every refering features that was pointing to the former
feature will refer to the new one. In order to validate this change every
referring feature is asked if the replacement is possible according to it. As
Generative Shape Design Application allow sharing among features, i. e. several
features can refers a same feature, this capability can lead up to surprise if
the original design was now well done.</p>
A particular Sample explains how the Replace mechanism can be implemented onto a
new feature [<a href="#References">4</a>].
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Edit"></a>Edit Capability</h5>
<p>Every CATIA V5 feature has for responsability to be editable, that is to say
the user can modify the input of this feature interactively at any time. This is
another difference that exists between geometrical features and explicit
geometry. After this modification the feature will be Updated and the refereing
features will be impacted.The Edit task leads up to an Update of at least the
edited feature.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Remove"></a>Remove Capability</h5>
<p>Every CATIA V5 feature can be deleted, and by doing this the user will be
asked to delete or not referring fetures that will not be consistent anymore
afterwards.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Isolate"></a>Isolate and Datum Capability</h5>
<p>Different Shape/Wireframe features can be created in Datum mode, in order to
have explicit geometry instead of associative specifications. This is also the
case when the user Isolate a Feature, by doing this he supresses the reference
to other features, and this feature won't be impacted by any modification in the
model.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="Inside"></a>What Is Inside a Shape/Wireframe Feature?</h3>
<p>Wireframe and Skin Features are Specifications that have a BRep
representation in 3D, which is managed in a Topological Modeler. The link
between toppology and input specifications is maintained thanks to a technology
called Generic Naming.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Generic"></a>Generic Naming Technology</h5>
<p>As a feature is a specification, and the result of this specification
(Geometry and/or Topology) may change in life cycle of a feature, there is need
to name in a stable manner every sub-element (Vertex, Edge, Face) of a
Geometrical Feature that can be referenced by any other features. This naming is
mandatory to be able to reference a Face of a Solid (e.g for the offset feature)
or an Edge (e.g for a Fillet Feature).</p>
<p>The Solid Face can change if we add any other feature impacting this Face
(Split, Boolean or simply change its limit type), the generic naming technology
has to guarantee that the Face can be named even if the sub-element is
re-computed. This technology enable the existence of BRep features that as for
representation the sub-element found by the naming algorithm, those features can
be input specifications for Shape/Wireframe Features and enable Hybrid
Modelling.(i.e. mixed modelling with Skin and Solid primitives.)</p>
<p>Every Geometrical Feature has to declare how those sub-element are named
regarding its input specifications.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Topology"></a>Topological Objects Linked to Specifications</h5>
<p>A Shape/Wireframe feature uses an Operator to generate the topological result
that represents it in 3D View. These operators create Topological Objects linked
together. Each Wireframe/Shape Feature has its own representation that is made
of Topological Objects. Those operators are able to handle several dimension,
for example the Extrude feature call a Hybrid Prism Operator that is able to
extrude a Vertex, a Wire (a group of edge), or a Shell. The same Operator is
called with different input for the Pad Feature. An example can be found for
those topological operators [<a href="#References">5</a>].</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Multi"></a>Multitype Features</h5>
<p>Several basic features are <a href="#who">multitype features</a>, that kind
of feature enable the user to dynamically change its type, and thus change the
way the feature is driven. You can change a Plane Equation into a Plane Offset
without creating a new feature and replace the old one by the new one.<br>
There is a particular type shared by all multitype features that is explicit,
this type is the equivalent of isolating a feature. The main advantage is to be
able to change from explicit to a non-explicit (procedural) subtype, in order to
link this feature back to other specifications.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Federator"></a>Using the Open Body Federator Feature</h5>
<p>Every Shape/Wireframe features are created in Open Body features, those
federator features are used to group specifications in dedicated bags in order
to clarify the Design of a Complex V5 Part. An Open Body can be created inside
an Open Body, there can be as many Open Body as the user wants. An Open Body
can't be created in a Part Body.</p>
<p>Open Body group features, and the order in this Open Body is not significant
(in Part Body the order is significant and the reorder capability enable the
user to modify the order inside a Part Body, and thus modify the design intent).</p>
<p>An open body feature is like a bag whose responsibiliity is to aggregate
other features, like other open bodies or shape design features (Wireframe,
Skins and Transformations.) An open body has a structuring role that can be used
to split the design of a complex part in several goup of connex design features.
This enables any user to better understand the way a part has been designed.</p>

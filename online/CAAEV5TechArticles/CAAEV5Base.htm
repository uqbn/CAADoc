<h3><a name="Learn"></a>Overview of customization capabilities</h3>
<p>ENOVIA is fully integrated with CATIA. Inside the PLM Architecture, one can 
deploies customization pattern that are located either on the LCA server side or 
either on CATIA cleint side. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Customization is made of Declarative pattern or/and Programmatic 
pattern.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>One typical declarative pattern on ENOVIA server side is the definition 
	of customizations of the ENOVIA Data model which is mainly done in using the 
	RADE/DMC tool. The customized data model are then put in action in the CATIA 
	client side, where those data can be created or modified by end user under 
	the control of Integration facilities. </li>
	<li>One typical declarative pattern on the client side is the definition of 
	the attribute mapping that Integration software put in action to define 
	which ENOVIA attribute will be associated with&nbsp; which CATIA Attribute.</li>
	<li>One typical programmatic pattern on the ENOVIA server side is the 
	implementation Object domain events. They are triggered by the CATIA client 
	when some operations are performed on the server like modifying ENOVIA 
	object attribute, changing ownership, ... It implies CAA API programming</li>
	<li>One typical programmatic pattern on the CATIA client side is witing CAA 
	command code either for VPM Navigator purpose or for CATIA Product 
	Structure. This provides end user with dedicated command that will help him 
	creating product structure compliant with customer rules regarding specific 
	ENOVIA data model customization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is the overview of customization pattern that can be deployed on server 
or on client in the context of ENOVIA V5 VPM. </p>

<h3><a name="EV5Server"></a>ENOVIA Server considerations</h3>
<p>The ENOVIA LCA Server provides capabilities for customizing&nbsp; many 
feature for the client using it. Although the same ENOVIA Data modeler 
are used from LCA Navigator client (EBOM application) or ENOVIA V5 VPM client (CATIA 
Product structure), there are differences in the way cusotmization operates in a 
specific client context. There are specific customization feature for LCA Navigator and 
specific customization for ENOVIA V5 VPM. Hereafter we explain main differences 
in the customization of the server: </p>
<UL>
  <LI>LCA 
	Navigator client &amp; related applications are not CAA opened. however most of 
	the operations triggered by those client application are encapsulated into dedicated 
	server code offering specific customization capabilities. Typically server 
	customization feature related to LCA Navigator client GUI does generally 
	apply to ENOVIA V5 VPM GUI.
	<p>Moreover, many events, one is triggering on the server when working with 
	LCA Navigator application are never triggered on server when working from the CATIA client because 
	they are specific operations involved by specific LCA Navigator application commands 
	(i.e. Cut or Paste event). 
  <LI>ENOVIA V5 VPM &amp; related applications are CAA opened, they provide CAA 
	client 
	modeler API and CAA User Exit API that can be customized on the client side. Typical 
	ENOVIA V5 VPM GUI customization is operated on the client by specific client 
	customization. </UL>

<p>One of the main customization feature offered on the server is provided by 
the RADE/DMC application. It enables adding attributes to many of the 
ENOVIA Server data modeler objects. Although the data customization is possible 
on the server for both client, there are restriction in the RADE/DMC feature 
that are supported by one or the other client. For instance, attribute list and 
customer relations are not supported by ENOVIA V5 VPM. </p>

<p>Other customization feature are defined only in the server, like People &amp; Organisation Masks, Lifecycle status, ... 
From client point of view the customization is working the same. </p>
<p>People &amp; Organization Securities are defined on the server. Security context 
are customizable the same, but one must pay attention that there're might 
different securities implied from one or the other client, because the involved 
security processes are in relationship with the involved modeler capabilities. 
Nevertheless basic security processes are supported the same: Create, Update, 
Delete, Write, Lock, ChangeStatus, ...</p>

<h3><a name="EV5VPM"></a>ENOVIA V5 VPM client architecture</h3>
<p>As explained above, ENOVIA V5 VPM uses the ENOVIA LCA Server and put in action 
several data modeler. Hereafter some terminolgy to better understand the 
relation between the ENOVIA LCA modeler &amp; the CATIA modelers. </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>Part</b>: an ENOVIAV5 part (named Part Reference in 
	the ENOVIA LCA GUI, as provided by the LCA PRODUCT modeler) can correspond 
	to<br>
	. either a CATIAV5 root product (top of the specification tree in the CATIA 
	GUI) in a CATPart or CATProduct document<br>
	. or a CATIAV5 component-type node in a CATProduct document which is not 
	kept in ENOVIAV5 (save option &#8220;Structure Exposed&#8221;)</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>Document</b>: an ENOVIAV5 document (named Document 
	Revision in the ENOVIA LCA GUI, as provided by the LCA DOCDIR modeler) 
	corresponds to most of CATIA documents (CATProduct, CATPart, catalog, 
	CATDrawing, CATAnalysis&#8230;). <b>Document Master (DM) / Document Revision (DV)</b>: 
	to manage versioning, ENOVIAV5 handles documents with these 2 different 
	types of objects: several Document Revisions can exist for a given Document 
	Master</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>Domain</b>: ENOVIA V5 standard and customized data 
	schemas organize different ENOVIA objects into Domains. Domains have names, 
	standard ENOVIA V5 objects can be derived in a customized domain by adding 
	customer-defined attributes to the standard object. The standard domain name 
	for documents is DOCDIR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hereafter is the picture explaining how the client 
architecture is delivered. It helps to understand the typical user process &amp; 
components implied when working in ENOVIA V5 VPM context </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../CAAEV5TechArticles/images/EV5VPMArchi.jpg" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>
On the above picture, User is navigating on the persistent ENOVIA data (light 
blue window). He can open the data in the Authoring session (dark blue window), 
and work for hours modifiying those data. Hundred of modifications can then be 
propagated (saved) all at once on the server. Hereafter we present the main 
client component supporting this user data modification process.</p>

<h4><a name="EV5VPMInt"></a>VPM integration</h4>
<p>VPM integration provides </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The underlying software for managing Open/Save of 
	ENOVIA data in CATIA It offers CATIA facilities like attribute mapping to 
	decide whether such ENOVIA domain attribute should be mapped on CATIA 
	Product Modeler or document Modeler attributes. </li>
	<li>
	<p>Once opened in CATIA, those Data can be modified by 
	many application like Product Structure, Assembly design, Part design .... 
	<p>As long as data are opened in session, no ENOVIA server modification are 
	applied, but are recorded in the form of long transaction to be further &quot;replayed&quot; 
	to ENOVIA Server when the user will order saving. Only at that time the 
	ENOVIA server will be involved, and all modifications will take effect and 
	be committed at once. During that time, many ENOVIA Server feature are 
	implied like P&amp;O Securities, </li>
	<li>
	<p>The connectivity with the ENOVIA server involving from 
	CATIA the required conversion &amp; calling the required ENOVIA modeler 
	capabilities to reflect what has been done during the CATIA Session.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="EV5VPMNav"></a>VPM Navigator</h4>
<p>VPM Navigator provides </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>GUI to Access to persistent data thanks to dedicated 
	navigation facilities like queries or expand graph. 
	<p>Queries or Expand Graph 
	are interfaced with the server &amp; fully support P&amp;O Mask customization on the 
	server side. 
	<p>Many ENOVIA modeler objects can be seen there, much more than 
	CATIA may natively operates: like ENOVIA GCO, Configuration Handler, 
	Effetivities, Actions, ...</li>
	<li>
	<p>GUI to Manage the CATIA session data in providing 
	Filtered Open in CATIA or Save with Action from CATIA tools. 
	<p>It provides 
	dedicated Open behavior that matches CATIA User needs &amp;&nbsp; Decision 
	support to better manage the CATIA session content &amp; the relationship with 
	ENOVIA. 
	<p>One one the Decision support tool is obviously save management 
	implying ENOVIA Mapping when creating data, or ENOVIA Versioning when an 
	ENOVIA data is already frozen, ENOVIA configuration modification through 
	Action, .... 
	<p>It also provides End User with Relational tool to address CATIA 
	cooperative design processes &amp; dependancy analysis. 
	<p>Moreover it also 
	provides dedicated tools to reconcialite design with latest version of a 
	CATIA design object.</li>
	<li>
	<p>GUI to Manage persistent data in short transaction. It 
	consists of operations that are directly applied to the ENOVIA Server &amp; 
	automatically commited. 
	<p>It provides modification of Data attribute without 
	needing to open in CATIA any data. 
	<p>It also provides some advanced ENOVIA 
	cooperative feature Locking, or changing ownership or lifecycle 
	manipulations.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="CATVPM"></a>Authoring Applications</h4>
<p>Authoring is one of the many application available in CATIA:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It can be Product Authoring as provided by the CATIA 
	Product Structure Application. It can also be Assembly Design. Notice those 
	application may suppport Native ENOVIA PRODUCT Modeling,&nbsp; implying 
	ENOVIA Product (PRC), ItemInstances, Part,&nbsp; AseemblyRelations and so 
	forth.</li>
	<li>
	<p>It can be also pure Mechanical Design Authoring as 
	provided by CATIA Part Editor or Shape Modeling as provided by CATIA GSD 
	applications. Those are interfaced with ENOVIA DOCDIR documents. Notice that 
	CATPart are Documents but also contains ENOVIA Part corresponding to the 
	CATIA Product side of the CATPart.</li>
	<li>
	<p>It can also be pure Evaluation Activities as offered by 
	CATIA. Review activities on Product are interfaced with ENOVIA PRODUCT&nbsp; 
	Technological Packages. FEM activities are supported by CATAnalysis CATIA 
	Document wich are interfaced with ENOVIA DOCDIR.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that all these CATIA applications have their own CAA 
offering. These offering may deal with Extending the Application GUI in 
including new CAA Commands in the applications. They may also deal with CATIA Authoring 
API that stand for the client modeling API for ENOVIA. </p>

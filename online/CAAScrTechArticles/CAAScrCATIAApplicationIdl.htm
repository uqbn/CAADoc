/**
 * Represents the current application and its frame window.
 * The application is the root object for all the other objects you can use
 * and access from scripts. It directly aggregates:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;The document collection represented by the @href CATIADocuments object.
 * This collection contains all the documents currently opened by the
 * application
 * &lt;li&gt;The window collection represented by the @href CATIAWindows object.
 * This collection contains all the windows currently opened by the
 * application, each window displaying one of the documents contained in
 * the document collection
 * &lt;li&gt;The @href CATIASystemService object, providing information about
 * the system environment.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The active document and the active window are two key objects for the
 * application you can access using the @href #ActiveDocument
 * and @href #ActiveWindow properties respectively.
 * The active window is the window the end user is
 * currently working in, and the active document is the document displayed
 * in this active window and that the end user is being editing.
 * This document sets its workshop, that is the available menus and
 * toolbars that make it possible to edit it, according to its type.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When you create or use macros for in-process access, the application
 * is always referred to as &lt;tt&gt;CATIA&lt;/tt&gt;.

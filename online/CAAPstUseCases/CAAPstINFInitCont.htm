<h3><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h3>
<p>This use case is intended to illustrate how to program the necessary
initialization tasks that must be performed in order for certain feature
behaviors to function correctly at runtime. One of these initialization tasks
concerns the declaration of providers. Because the features created in this use
case are &quot;from scratch&quot; features, meaning that they do not derive from
any existing feature that may already be known to the navigation, visualization
or update processes, it is necessary to use providers in order to be able to
take them into account. The declaration of providers is not persistent to the
document. It is necessary, therefore, to declare them each time the document is
opened.&nbsp; Since providers refer to &quot;from scratch&quot; features that
are stored in applicative containers, it seems reasonable, then, to perform the
declaration of providers in the initialization process of the applicative
container, which is called whenever the Product document is loaded into the
session.&nbsp;Likewise, visualization connections between objects is also a
non-persistent mechanism that has to be renewed at document load-time.
Therefore, in this use case, you will see how to program the provider
declarations that handle the integration of your new features in the navigation,
visualization and update processes as well as how to connect the root features
to the Product root and the aggregated features to their feature root in order
to correctly structure the document for visualization purposes.&nbsp;
<p>You should already be familiar with the CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures use case
article [<a href="#References">1</a>] in order to more easily understand the
context of this particular use case. A general pre-requisite knowledge of the
Feature Modeler and of Providers may be required to fully understand this
sample. You may want to review the basics of the Feature Modeler by looking over
the &quot;Feature Modeler Overview&quot; technical article [<a href="#References">2</a>].
You may also want to look at the &quot;Using the Provider Mechanism&quot; use
case [<a href="#References">3</a>] which describes the basics of the Provider
mechanism. Finally, it may be useful for you to look over the &quot;Product
Structure Model&quot; technical article [<a href="#References">4</a>] as well.</p>

<h3><a name="UseCase"></a>The CAAPstINFInitCont Use Case</h3>
<p>The CAAPstINFInitCont a use case that is part of the
CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures use case defined in the CAAProductStructure.edu
framework that illustrates the integration of ObjectSpecsModeler,
ObjectModelerBase and ProductStructure framework capabilities in the scope of a
Product document.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="What"></a>What Does the CAAPstINFInitCont Use Case Do</h4>
<p>This use case essentially describes the applicative container's
implementation of the <i>CATInit</i> interface in which the necessary provider
declarations and feature inter-connections are performed.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the contents of the Product document. Initially, the
Product document is created and the &quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; applicative
container is created within it. Next, two &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features are
instantiated in the applicative container, the first that will aggregate the
other features and the second that will be used during the interactive scenario
to demonstrate CCP capabilities. Five &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features are
then instantiated in the applicative container, each having different coordinate
values. A &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; feature is instantiated next, whose
attribute values reference the first two &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features.
Finally, a &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; feature is instantiated, whose attribute
value references a list containing the last three &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;
features. The &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and
&quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; features are then aggregated by the first
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; feature. Here are the contents of the new Product
document:</p>
<b>Fig. 1: Contents of the CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct document.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFCatalog.jpg" width="336" height="296"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and
&quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; types of features are the elements in the list of
components of the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; feature. Also, notice that the
&quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; attributes point to &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; and
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint2&quot; through a &quot;SpecObject&quot; link and that
the&nbsp; &quot;CAAPstINFWire1&quot; attribute points to a list containing the
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint3&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFPoint4&quot;,
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint5&quot; features also through a &quot;SpecObject&quot;
link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see, in this case, that the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; feature
aggregates the other features, meaning that if &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; were
to be deleted, all of the aggregated features would be deleted as well. The
&quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; object, on the other hand, only references the two
points that make up its definition, meaning that if it is deleted, the two
points continue to exist independently. Inversely, however, if ever one of the
two points is deleted, it is necessary to delete the line as well, since its
definition will no longer be valid.</p>
<p>Note that nowhere in this document have we specified where the
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; nodes themselves are to be structured. This operation
will take place during the initialization of the applicative container, at
runtime. When the Product document is opened in the CATIA interactive session,
the implementation of the <i>CATInit</i>::<code>Init</code> method for the
&quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; applicative container is executed. This method
declares the provider implementations that will need to be executed during the
navigation and visualization processes in order to structure the
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features under the Product root in the specs tree and
to be able to visualize the geometry of the point and line features. So, when
the document is finally visualized, it looks like this:</p>
<b>Fig. 2: Initial loading of CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct document.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFDocument.jpg" width="545" height="447"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFRoot2&quot;
features are structured directly under the Product root. This is defined in the
navigation provider implementation. Remember that the navigation provider
mechanism has been implemented for all products in a Product document. This
means that during the navigation process, for each product node, any navigation
provider that is currently declared to the document will be executed. So, in
order to structure the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features under the product
root, the navigation provider code retrieves the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; types
of features from the &quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; applicative container and returns
them as children nodes whenever the provider is called by the Product root
object during the navigation process.</p>
<p>Note also that the geometry of the points, line and wire is also visualized,
whereas these are applicative features stored in an applicative container and
are not automatically taken into account during the visualization process. In
order these objects to be treated, a visualization provider must also have been
declared, which, when called, returns the list of the aggregating feature root
nodes. Then, the <i>CATI3DGeoVisu</i> implementation for each feature root as
well as for each aggreagted object in order to define the visualization.</p>
<p>Remember that &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; is defined based on
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFPoint2&quot;. If ever one of
these point features were to be modified, the line feature would have to be
updated. But, because any number of features could be dependent on the same
point feature for their own definition, the update process is implemented at the
Product root level. The Product root, however, does not have any knowledge of
all of the different &quot;from scratch&quot; features that may exist in the
document. It is necessary, therefore, to declare an update provider that will be
called by the Product root whenever it is requested to update.</p>
<p>The scope of this use case, however, is not to illustrate the provider
mechanism for these processes, but rather to demonstrate the construction of the
document and the declaration of the necessary providers. Other use cases dealing
with navigation [<a href="#References">5</a>], visualization [<a href="#References">6</a>]
and update [<a href="#References">7</a>] will detail each of these processes.</p>

<p align="left">For each feature root, we would now like to retrieve every
feature it aggregates and connect this feature to it. In order to do this, we
first need to get a <i>CATISpecAttrAccess</i> pointer on the feature root. Then,
using the <code>GetAttrKey</code> method, we can retrieve the attribute key
pointing to the list of features. Next, we prepare to connect the aggregated
features by retrieving a <i>CATIModelEvents</i> pointer on the feature root.
Note that an implementation of this interface for the feature root must already
have been provided. Now we can scan through the list of features using the <code>Beginning</code>
and <code>Next</code> methods of <i>CATISpecAttrAccess</i> and retrieve a
pointer to each feature using the <code>GetSpecObject</code> method. Finally,
each aggregated feature can be connected to its root using the <code>ConnectTo</code>
method of <i>CATIModelEvents</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h3>
<p>This use case is intended to illustrate how to create new features in an
applicative container of a Product document and how to integrate these features
in the following basic V5 mechanisms:
<ul>
  <li><b>Navigation</b>: this mechanism allows a feature to be visualized in the
    specs tree of the Product document and to list its children through a
    collapsable node.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization</b>: this mechanism allows the feature to be included in
    the visualization process in order for its geometry to be visible.</li>
  <li><b>Editing</b>: this mechanism allows the feature's data values to be
    modified.</li>
  <li><b>Update</b>: this mechanism allows a feature's data and visualization to
    be updated whenever any of the features it depends on have been modified.</li>
  <li><b>Cut, Copy, Paste</b>: this mechanism allows features to be cut or
    copied and pasted to and from the same or different containers.</li>
  <li><b>Delete</b>: this mechanism allows a feature to be deleted from the
    applicative container, specs tree and viewer while at the same time deleting
    any other features whose definition may be dependent on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is still incomplete and is planned to be enriched with
illustrations of other mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new applicative feature can be created in a Product document without any
behaviors at all. Basic behaviors can then be added little by little, one by
one, without any interference of one with the other. The outline of this article
follows this principle, as it is based on independent articles, each describing
a basic mechanism, which, when put together, illustrate the coherent integration
of new features in V5.</p>
<p>Some of the behaviors illustrated here are defined in various V5 Frameworks:</p>

<p>A quick note about Providers: The Provider mechanism, used to integrate
&quot;from scratch&quot; features in a product structure, is implemented in the
ObjectSpecsModeler framework. However, it is essentially used by
ProductStructure implementations on Product features which is why this use case
is based on a Product document example and delivered with ProductStructure
framework CAA documentation.</p>
<p>A general pre-requisite knowledge of the frameworks described above may be
required to fully understand this sample, but some links with other CAA V5 use
cases will be indicated to help you navigate among them. To begin with, you may
want to review the basics of the Feature Modeler that you can find in the
&quot;Feature Modeler Overview&quot; technical article [<a href="#References">1</a>].
You may also find it useful to look over the &quot;Product Structure Model&quot;
technical article [<a href="#References">2</a>] as well.</p>

<h3><a name="UseCase"></a>The CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures Use Case</h3>
<p>The CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures is a use case of the CAAProductStructure.edu
framework that illustrates the integration of ObjectSpecsModeler,
ObjectModelerBase, Visualization, ApplicationFrame, Dialog and
ProductStructure&nbsp; framework capabilities in the scope of a Product
document.</p>

<h4><a name="What"></a>What Does the CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures Use Case Do</h4>
<p>This use case illustrates creating new applicative features &quot;from
scratch&quot;, instantiating them in an applicative container of a Product
document and attributing different behaviors to them in order to be able to
perform basic operations.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the feature catalog containing the &quot;StartUps&quot;
which define the basic data structure of each of the features that will be
created in this use case:</p>
<b>Fig 1: Contents of the CAAPstINFCatalog.CATfct file</b>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFCatalog.jpg" width="336" height="296"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; represents the parent node that will aggregate
    all the other features. Its unique attribute contains a list of components,
    in other words, a list of the features that it aggregates.</li>
  <li>&quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; is a feature representing a 3D geometrical
    point. Its attributes contain the values of the x, y and z coordinates of
    the point.</li>
  <li>&quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; is a feature representing a 3D geometrical line.
    Its attributes contain references to the two points of type
    &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; that define the line.</li>
  <li>&quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; is a feature representing a 3D geometrical line
    as well. Its attribute contains a list of at least two
    &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features that define the wire.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you remember, the difference between an aggregated object and a referenced
object in the context of the feature modeler is that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an object is <b>aggregated</b> by only one &quot;parent&quot;; its
    existence is dependent on this parent, i.e., if the parent is deleted, it
    must also be deleted.&nbsp;This is sometimes called a &quot;Component&quot;
    link because the attribute containing an aggregated link is defined as a
    &quot;tk_component&quot; attribute.</li>
  <li>an object can be <b>referenced</b> by any number of other objects and its
    existence is independent of the objects that reference it. This is sometimes
    called a &quot;SpecObject&quot; link because the attribute containing the
    referenced link is defined as a &quot;tk_specobject&quot; attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we understand what data objects we are working with and how they
interact with each other, let's take a look at the Product document that we want
to create. Initially, the Product document will be created in batch mode. A new
applicative container of type &quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; is created in which two
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features are instantiated, the first that will
aggregate the other features and the second that will be used during the
interactive scenario to demonstrate CCP capabilities. Next, five
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features are instantiated, each having different
coordinate values. Then, a &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; feature is instantiated,
whose attribute values reference the first two &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;
features. Finally, a &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; feature is instantiated and its
attribute points to a list containing references to the last three
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features.&nbsp; The &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;,
&quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; features are then
aggregated by the first &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; feature. Here are the contents
of the new Product document:</p>
<b>Fig. 2: Contents of the CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct document.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFDocStructure.jpg" width="428" height="438"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the five &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; features, the
&quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; feature and &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; feature are the
elements in the list of components of the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; feature.
Also, notice that the &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; feature points to
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFPoint2&quot; through a
&quot;SpecObject&quot; link and that the &quot;CAAPstINFWire1&quot; feature
points to &quot;CAAPstINFPoint3&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFPoint4&quot;, and
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint5&quot; through a &quot;SpecObject&quot; link as well.</p>
<p>You can see, in this case, that &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; aggregates the
other features, meaning that if &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; were to be deleted,
all of the aggregated features would be deleted as well. The
&quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and the &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot; objects, on the
other hand, only reference the points that make up their definitions, meaning
that if they were to be deleted, the points would continue to exist
independently. Inversely, however, in the case of the line, for example, if ever
one of the points were to be deleted, it would be necessary to delete the line
as well, since its definition would no longer be valid. Here is a UML diagram
describing the links between these features:</p>
<b>Fig. 3: UML diagram of the three new features.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFFeatureLinks.jpg" width="596" height="173"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that nowhere in this document have we specified where the
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; nodes themselves are to be structured. This operation
will take place during the initialization of the applicative container, at
runtime. When the Product document is opened in the V5 interactive session, the
implementation of the <i>CATInit</i>::<code>Init</code> method for the
&quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; applicative container is executed. This method
declares the provider implementations that will need to be executed during the
navigation and visualization processes in order to structure the
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features under the Product root in the specs tree and
to be able to visualize the geometry of the point, line and wire features. So,
when the document is finally visualized, it looks like this:</p>
<b>Fig. 4: Initial loading of CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct document.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFDocument.jpg" width="545" height="447"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFRoot2&quot;
features are structured directly under the Product root. This is defined in the
navigation provider implementation. Remember that the navigation provider
mechanism has been implemented for all products in a Product document. This
means that during the navigation process, for each product node, any navigation
provider that is currently declared to the document will be executed. So, in
order to structure the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; features under the product
root, the navigation provider code retrieves the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; types
of features from the &quot;CAAPstINFCont&quot; applicative container and returns
them as children nodes whenever the provider is called by the Product root
object during the navigation process.</p>
<p>Note also that the geometry of the points and line is also visualized,
whereas these are applicative features stored in an aplicative container and are
not automatically taken into account during the visualization process. In order
these objects to be treated, a visualization provider must also have been
declared, which, when called, returns the list of the aggregating feature root
nodes. Then, the <i>CATI3DGeoVisu</i> implementation for each feature root as
well as for each aggreagted object in order to define the visualization.</p>
<p>See the technical article entitled &quot;Using the Provider Mechanism&quot; [<a href="#References">3</a>]
for another example of how providers work.</p>
<p>Now, once the features are correctly represented in the navigation and
visualization processes of the Product document, we would like to enable the
features to be edited: a double-click on the feature node or geometrical
representation causes the display of a dialog box, as seen in the following
screen image:</p>
<b>Fig. 5: Editing a &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; feature.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFEdit1.jpg" width="547" height="449"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The dialog box entitled &quot;Point Definition&quot; contains the values of
the coordinates of the selected point. Initially, these values were all set to
0.0. The Y coordinate value is changed to 100.0 in the dialog box and when
selecting the OK button, the following modification occurs:</p>
<b>Fig. 6: Result of &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot; feature modification.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFEdit2.jpg" width="544" height="446"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the position of the point has changed and the impacted line
has been re-drawn to reflect the referenced point's modification. This use case
will show you in detail how this modification must be programmed.</p>
<p>Next, we want to illustrate copying a feature from one node to another or
within the same node. This is done using the CCP mechanism. Here is a screen
image showing this behavior:</p>
<b>Fig. 7: Copying a feature.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFCCP1.jpg" width="544" height="447"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The contextual menu on the feature has been enabled to offer the Cut, Copy,
Paste and Delete options. Here, the Copy operation has been selected. Next, a
Paste operation will be selected on the second &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot; node,
as seen below:</p>
<b>Fig. 8: Pasting a feature.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFCCP2.jpg" width="545" height="536"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature has been copied to create a new
instance called &quot; CAAPstINFPoint1.1&quot; that is aggregated under
&quot;CAAPstINFRoot2&quot;. Here is the result of the CCP operation:</p>
<b>Fig. 9: Result of Copy/Paste operation.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFCCP3.jpg" width="546" height="446"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Lastly, we want to illustrate deleting a feature. To do this, we select the
Delete option of the contextual menu on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature:</p>
<b>Fig. 10: Deleting a feature.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFDel1.jpg" width="545" height="447"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the feature is deleted, any object pointing to it that is dependent on
it for its definition, such as the &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; feature, must be
deleted as well. The result of the Delete operation on the point can be seen in
the following screen image:</p>
<b>Fig. 11: Result of deleting a feature.</b>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAPstINFDel2.jpg" width="545" height="445"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that two points are left: &quot;CAAPstINFPoint2&quot; which existed
originally and &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1.1&quot; which is a copy of the
&quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature that was just deleted.</p>
<p>Below is a figure showing the interface implementations necessary for each
new feature type created in order to enable the operations described above:</p>
<p><b>Fig. 12: Basic interface implementations necessary to integrate new

    all four features: &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;,
    &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot;. It manages the cut
    and copy operations for the point, line and wire features and paste

  <li>
    <p align="left"><i>CATINavigateObject</i> - this interface is implemented

    &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot;. It filters the
    CCP/Delete options of the contextual menu that are allowed on each
    particular feature. For example, for the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot&quot;, we do
    not want to allow cut, copy or delete, but only paste. On the contrary, for
    the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;, &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and

<h4><a name="How"></a>How to Launch the CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures Use Case</h4>
<p>To launch the CAAPstIntegrateNewFeatures use case, you will need to set up
the build time environment, then compile the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAAPstINFBuildCatalog.m</li>
  <li>CAAPstINFCreateDocument.m</li>
  <li>CAAPstINFInterfaces.m</li>
  <li>CAAPstINFCommands.m</li>
  <li>CAAPstINFModeler.m&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;along with their prerequisites [<a href="#References">4</a>]. Several
steps must be followed in order to completely execute the use case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By batch, launch the following command:</li>
  <pre>    mkrun -c &quot;CAAPstINFBuildCatalog CatalogStorageName&quot;</pre>
  where <code>CatalogStorageName</code> is the entire pathname, name and <code>.CATfct</code>
  suffix of the catalog to be created. It is recommended that the new catalog be
  stored in the CNext + resources + graphic directory of the current framework;
  then, by updating the runtime view, the catalog will be moved to the runtime
  directory and will be accessible by subsequent programs. This batch program
  creates new StartUps in a new catalog. A catalog called
  &quot;CAAPstINFCatalog.CATfct&quot; has also, however, been supplied with this
  use case, so you can skip this step if you want to use it instead. If you do
  re-create a new catalog by launching this batch program, be sure that the name
  of the catalog is unique in the directory you specify, otherwise, your new
  catalog will not be able to be saved.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <li>By batch, launch the following command:</li>
  <pre>    mkrun -c &quot;CAAPstINFCreateDocument CatalogName DocumentStorageName&quot;</pre>
  where <code>CatalogName</code> is the name and .<code>CATfct</code> suffix of
  the catalog containing the StartUps to be retrieved in the document and <code>DocumentStorageName</code>
  is the entire pathname, name and .<code>CATProduct</code> suffix of the
  document to be created. This batch program will create the Product document
  containing an applicative container in which the new features will be
  instantiated. Like the catalog, a document called
  &quot;CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct&quot; has already been supplied with this
  use case, so this step can be skipped as well.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <li>
    <p>Launch <b>CATIA</b>. When the application is ready, follow the scenario
    described below:
    <p>&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Select <b>File</b> + <b>Open</b> and select the <b><code>CAAPstINFDocument.CATProduct
        </code></b>in the <code>CAAProductStructure.edu/CNext/resources/graphic</code>
        directory or select the document you created yourself by executing the
        batch program described in the previous step.&nbsp;</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Collapse</b> the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot1&quot; node by selecting the
        &quot;+&quot; symbol: notice that this root aggregates seven features of
        which five are of type &quot;CAAPstINFPoint&quot;, one
        &quot;CAAPstINFLine&quot; and one &quot;CAAPstINFWire&quot;.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Double-click</b> on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature: the
        &quot;Point Definition&quot; dialog box appears.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Modify</b> <b>the values </b>of any of the point coordinates and <b>select</b>
        <b>OK</b> or <b>press</b> <b>Enter</b>. Notice that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature has changed position and that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; feature has also been updated.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Double-click</b> on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint3&quot; feature: the
        &quot;Point Definition&quot; dialog box appears.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Modify</b> <b>the values </b>of any of the point coordinates and <b>select</b>
        <b>OK</b> or <b>press</b> <b>Enter</b>. Notice that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint3&quot; feature has changed position and that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFWire1&quot; feature has also been updated.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Display the contextual menu</b> on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot;
        feature.&nbsp;</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Select &quot;Copy&quot;</b>.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Display the contextual menu </b>on the &quot;CAAPstINFRoot2&quot;
        feature.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Select &quot;Paste&quot;</b>. Notice that a new feature,
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1.1&quot; has been aggregated to the
        &quot;CAAPstINFRoot2&quot; feature by copy/paste. The new point has the
        same coordinate values as the point it is copied from, so its geometry
        cannot be visualized.&nbsp;</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Double-click</b> on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1.1&quot; feature: the
        &quot;Point Definition&quot; dialog box appears.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Modify the values</b> of any of the point coordinates and <b>select
        OK</b> or <b>press Enter</b>. Now you can visualize the
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1.1&quot; since its coordinates are no longer the
        same as those of &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot;. The
        &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; feature has not changed at all because it is
        not dependent on the copy of &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; but on
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; itself.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Display the contextual menu</b> on the &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot;
        feature again.</p>
      <li>
        <p><b>Select &quot;Delete&quot;</b>. Notice that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot; feature has been deleted and that the
        &quot;CAAPstINFLine1&quot; feature has also been deleted because it can
        no longer exist without one of its reference points. The initial copy of
        &quot;CAAPstINFPoint1&quot;, however, continues to exist.</p>
    </ul>

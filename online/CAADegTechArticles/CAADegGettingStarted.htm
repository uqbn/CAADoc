<h3><a name="200000"></a>Designing the Line Command</h3>
<p>The Line command is a <em>state dialog command</em>. It is an interactive
command running in the application frame and that creates line geometrical
elements. A state dialog command is a state machine that uses states to let the
end user input the requested parameters, and transitions between states to
process these input parameters and progress in the statechart.</p>
<p>The Line command allows the end user to create a line by providing two
points. To simplify the example, it does not feature any undo capability.</p>
<p>Designing a dialog command follows these steps:
<ul>
  <li>Dialog specification</li>
  <li>Dialog description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the state dialog command is designed, you can create a class and the
methods to provide the command behavior. Then, you can integrate it into the
application to make it available for its targeted document type.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="210000"></a>Dialog Specification</h4>
<p>The Line command creates a line when the end user has provided two points.
This simple task may be described by the following dialog between the end user
and the Line command:
<ul>
  <li>Line command: &quot;Ready to create a Line. Indicate the start
    point&quot;.</li>
  <li>End user (indicating point coordinates with the mouse): &quot;This is the
    start point&quot;.</li>
  <li>Line command: &quot;Now indicate the end point&quot;.</li>
  <li>End user (indicating point coordinates with the mouse): &quot;This is the
    end point&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the Line command creates the line using the two points input using the
mouse indication.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="220000"></a>Dialog Description</h4>
<p><em>Statechart diagrams</em> allow you to describe a state dialog command as
a state machine in a graphical format. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is
used for such diagrams.</p>
<p><img src="images/GettingStartedStateChart.gif" alt="GettingStartedStateChart.gif (9621 bytes)" width="569" height="271"></p>
<p>The dialog flow starts with the initial state, which is a pseudo state that
has no incoming transition. The command is never in the initial state that
automatically skips to the first state. This first state is dedicated to the
start point input and is shown in the box using its <a href="#330000">state
identifier</a>. A prompt linked to the first state can invite the end user to
indicate this start point. The transition between the first state and the second
state is triggered as soon as the end user indicates a valid point. This happens
when the expected event is detected (the mouse left key is pressed), and when
the guard condition is satisfied. The transition action, that is create a
temporary point, is executed. A prompt linked to the second state can then
invite the end user to indicate the end point. The transition to the final state
is triggered as soon as the end user indicates a valid point. This creates the
line.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="300000"></a>Creating the Line Command</h3>
<p>The Line command creation is described as a step-by-step process to follow
the statechart diagram. Some parts of the code are not shown, such as the line
creation in the document. The complete code can be found in the CAADegGeoCommands.m module of the
CAADialogEngine.edu framework.</p>
<p>The Line command is created as the CAADegCreateLineCmd class deriving from the
CATStateCommand class that is provided as a template for all state dialog
commands. The CAADegCreateLineCmd class creation follows the following steps:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#310000">Declaring the State Dialog Command Class</a>: This step
    includes the declaration of the objects and methods needed by the Line
    command</li>
  <li><a href="#320000">Managing the Command Lifecycle</a>: This is necessary to
    decide what should happen when the command completes, and when another
    command is selected while the Line command is not completed</li>
  <li><a href="#330000">Defining End User Input</a>: The dialog receives the
    point coordinates by means of CATIndicationAgent class instances created and
    associated with the states in the overridden CATStateCommand <code>BuildGraph</code>
    method</li>
  <li><a href="#340000">Linking States and Providing Behavior</a>: This is done
    using transitions created in the <code>BuildGraph</code> method</li>
  <li><a href="#350000">Providing Condition and Action Methods</a>: Condition
    methods check the indicated point, and action methods create and display a
    temporary point for the first transition, and the 3D line for the second
    one.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="310000"></a>Declaring the State Dialog Command Class</h4>
<p>This shows how to create the class header file.&nbsp;The main to do is:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subclassing</strong>: any dialog command is modeled as a class. A
    state dialog command must derive from the CATStateCommand class.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>class CAADegCreateLineCmd : public CATStateCommand</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong>: they are located in the file CAADegCreateLineCmd.CATNls you will store in your framework's
    CNext\resources\msgcatalog directory. Resources of a state dialog command
    are the prompts you can associate with each state, and the undo prompts. The
    base class must be set as the second parameter.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CmdDeclareResource(CAADegCreateLineCmd,CATStateCommand);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: the command lifecycle is managed using its
    constructor and destructor, and using the methods <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>,
    and <code>Cancel</code>. <code>Activate</code> is called when the Line
    command takes the focus, <code>Desactivate</code> is called when a shared
    command takes the focus, and thus leaves the Line command on the command
    stack in its current state, and <code>Cancel</code> is called when the
    command completes, or when an exclusive command takes the focus and requests
    the Line command to be deleted.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATStatusChangeRC Activate   (CATCommand * iCmd, CATNotification * iNotif);
CATStatusChangeRC Desactivate(CATCommand * iCmd, CATNotification * iNotif);
CATStatusChangeRC Cancel     (CATCommand * iCmd, CATNotification * iNotif);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Statechart</strong>: the statechart is implemented by overriding
    the <code>BuildGraph</code> method.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>virtual void BuildGraph();</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dialog agent</strong>: a single dialog agent to both detect the
    end user click and return the location of the point clicked is enough, since
    it is valued in the first state, and then can be recycled during the first
    transition to be reused as a new one for the second state. The
    CATIndicationAgent class is appropriate for such a dialog agent. It is
    declared as a data member to be used in different methods.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATIndicationAgent * _daIndication;</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Guard conditions</strong>: they are provided as methods of the CAADegCreateLineCmd class.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATBoolean  CheckStartPoint(void * iUsefulData);
CATBoolean  CheckEndPoint(void * iUsefulData);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong>: they are also provided as methods of the CAADegCreateLineCmd class. <code>CreatePoint</code> is for the first transition
    to create a temporary point, and <code>CreateLine</code> is for the second
    transition to create the line.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATBoolean  CreatePoint(void * iUsefulData);
CATBoolean  CreateLine(void * iUsefulData);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>

<h4><a name="320000"></a>Managing the Command Lifecycle</h4>
<p>The command lifecycle is managed using the constructor and the destructor,
and using the three methods <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>, and
<code>Cancel</code>.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Constructor</strong>: it creates the command as an exclusive one
    thanks to the second argument of the CATStateCommand constructor set to <code>CATCommandModeExclusive</code>.
    A command that creates or modifies the document must always be declared as
    exclusive. The command identifier is passed as the first parameter of the
    CATStateCommand constructor.&nbsp; The command constructor includes code to
    enable object creation in the document that is not shown here.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAADegCreateLineCmd::CAADegCreateLineCmd()
                : CATStateCommand(&quot;CreateLineCmdId&quot;, CATCommandModeExclusive),
                  _daIndication(NULL), _FirstPoint(NULL)
{ ... // Include code to access the document }
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Destructor</strong>: it requests the destruction of the dialog
    agent created in the <code>BuildGraph</code> method, and deletes or releases
    data members created or retrieved in the constructor.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAADegCreateLineCmd::~CAADegCreateLineCmd()
{
  if ( NULL != _daIndication )
  {
    _daIndication-&gt;<b>RequestDelayedDestruction</b>();
    _daIndication = NULL;
  }
  ... // delete or release other data members
}
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code>Activate</code></strong> is called when the Line command
    takes the focus. This happen in two cases:
    <ol>
      <li>The command is just selected by the end user. The CAADegCreateLineCmd is
        instantiated and the dialog starts from the beginning</li>
      <li>The command restarts at the state that was current when a shared
        command took the focus from it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><code>Activate</code> is not overridden here, since the default behavior
    provided by the base class CATCommand is enough. <code>CATCommand::Activate</code>
    simply returns <code>CATStatusChangeRCCompleted</code> to state that the
    command normally takes the focus.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code>Desactivate</code></strong> is called when a shared command
    takes the focus. The Line command is frozen in its current state and put in
    the command stack. When the shared command will complete, the frozen Line
    command will be reactivated from its current state using the <code>Activate</code>
    method. <code>Desactivate</code> is not overridden here, since the default
    behavior provided by the base class CATCommand is enough. <code>CATCommand::Desactivate</code>
    simply returns <code>CATStatusChangeRCCompleted</code> to state that the
    command normally looses the focus.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> is called when the Line command
    completes, or when an exclusive command takes the focus and requests the
    Line command to be deleted. When the Line command completes, the focus is
    given to the default command (usually Select). <code>Cancel</code> must
    delete or release temporary objects created by the command, possibly after
    having removed them from the sets of objects. In this example, this code
    could be put in the destructor, but if the command were declared in repeat
    mode, this must be located here and nothing else should be done.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>

<h4><a name="330000"></a>Defining the End User Input</h4>
<p>The end user input is defined in the <code>BuildGraph</code> method by
creating the states, creating the dialog agent(s), and plugging the dialog
agent(s)&nbsp; to these states.
<ol>
  <li><strong>Creating the dialog states</strong>. They are created using:
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>GetInitialState</code> method for the first state
        <table class="code">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre>CATDialogState *stStartState = GetInitialState(&quot;stStartPointId&quot;);</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>The <code>AddDialogState</code> method for the second state
        <table class="code">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre>CATDialogState *stEndState = AddDialogState(&quot;stEndPointId&quot;);</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>stStartPointId</em> and <em>stEndPointId</em> arguments are
        used in the CAADegCreateLineCmd.CATNls file to assign state prompts to
        these states. Refer to <a href="CAADegResources.htm">Assigning Resources</a></li>
      <li>Neither the initial state nor the final state are explicitly created</li>
      <li>The states are automatically deleted when the command itself is
        deleted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Creating the dialog agent</strong>. The Line command uses one
    instance of the CATIndicationAgent class to read the start point and the end
    point input by the end user. The end user clicks in the screen plane, but
    the indication happens in fact in a plane defined thanks to the <code>SetMathPlane</code>
    method that assigns this plane to the dialog agent. In this command, the
    plane is a projection plane&nbsp; parallel to the screen plane. It is the
    default plane, when the <code>SetMathPlane</code> is not used.&nbsp; The point clicked on the
    screen is projected onto this plane.&nbsp;
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Plugging the dialog agent to these states</strong>. This dialog
    agent is enabled when it is plugged to a dialog state. This is done using
    the <code>AddDialogAgent</code> method.

<h4><a name="340000"></a>Linking States and Providing Behavior</h4>
<p>The states are linked with transitions that trigger actions if the guard
conditions are satisfied.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connecting states with transitions</strong>. The <code>AddTransition</code>
    method connects a <em>source</em> state set as its first argument to a <em>target</em>
    state sets as its second argument. The other arguments are used for
    conditions and actions.
    <table class="code">

          <pre>CATDialogTransition * pFirstTransition = AddTransition(SourceState, TargetState, ...)</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Two transitions are created: one between the first state and the second
    state, and one between the second state and the final state. The transition
    between the initial state and the first state is implicit and should not be
    created. Note that the final state is referred to by the <code>NULL</code>
    value. Ellipsis show temporarily missing arguments.</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATDialogTransition * pFirstTransition = AddTransition(stStartState, stEndState, ...);

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Defining input validation using guard conditions</strong>. A guard
    condition is defined using the address of the method to execute to check the
    condition&nbsp; passed to the <code>Condition</code> method.
    <p>For each point, the Line command checks two conditions:
    <ol>
      <li>If a point has been provided by the end user. This condition is
        implemented by using the <code>IsOutputSetCondition</code> method
        provided to check that the point indication dialog agent is valued.</li>
      <li>For the start point, if the point can be created, and for the end
        point, if it is not identical to the start point in addition to its
        ability to be created. These conditions are implemented by the <code>CheckStartPoint</code>
        and <code>CheckEndPoint</code> methods of the CAADegCreateLineCmd class.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These two conditions are merged in a composite condition. This composite
    condition is provided as the third argument of the <code>AddTransition</code>
    method and implemented by means of the <code>AndCondition</code> method.
    Ellipsis show temporarily missing arguments.</p>
    <table class="code">

  <li><strong>Defining actions</strong>. An action is defined using the address
    of the method to execute to perform the action passed to the <code>Action</code>
    method. The action is then added to a transition by using it as the last
    argument of the <code>AddTransition</code> method. The complete source code

<h4><a name="350000"></a>Providing Condition and Action Methods</h4>
<p>This is the implementation of the command behavior declared using the <code>BuildGraph</code>
method. The two condition methods are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>The <code>CheckStartPoint</code> method checks that the point can be
    created, that is, that&nbsp; the object that holds the point factory, here <code>_RootObject</code>,
    exists.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATBoolean CAADegCreateLineCmd::CheckStartPoint(void * iDummy)
{
  CATBoolean ret = TRUE;
  if ( ! _RootObject ) ret = FALSE;
  return ret;
}
</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>The <code>CheckEndPoint</code> retrieves the end point from the dialog
    agent as a CATMathPoint2D instance on the projection plane of the dialog
    agent using the <code>GetValue</code> method. The <code>GetMathPlane</code>
    retrieves the projection plane. It converts it as a
    CATMathPoint instance, that is a 3D point, using the <code>EvalPoint</code>
    method, and compares the distance between start and end points to a minimum
    tolerance <code>EPSILON</code>. If the two points are identical with respect
    to this tolerance, the dialog agent is recycled to be reused in the second
    state that becomes current again, because <code>FALSE</code> is returned.
    This enables the end user to select another end point. Otherwise, <code>TRUE</code>
    is returned.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATBoolean CAADegCreateLineCmd::CheckEndPoint(void * iDummy)
{
  CATBoolean ret = TRUE;
  if ( _FirstPoint ) 
  {
    CATMathPoint2D point2D = _daIndication-&gt;<b>GetValue</b>();
    CATMathPoint EndPoint;
    CATMathPlane ProjPlane = _daIndication-&gt;<b>GetMathPlane</b>();
    ProjPlane .<b>EvalPoint</b>(point2D.GetX(),point2D.GetY(), EndPoint);

    float x,y,z ;
    _FirstPoint-&gt;GetCoord(x,y,z);
    CATMathPoint StartPoint(x,y,z);
    if ( EndPoint.DistanceTo(StartPoint) &lt; EPSILON ) 
    { 
      ret = FALSE;
      _daIndication-&gt;<b>InitializeAcquisition</b>(); // Recycle dialog agent
    }
  }
  else ret = FALSE;
  return ret;
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The two action methods are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>The <code>CreatePoint</code> method is called when the first transition is
    triggered. It creates the start point as a temporary point and puts it in
    the Interactive Set of Objects (this is not described here). It then
    recycles the dialog agent that can be reused for the second state.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATBoolean CAADegCreateLineCmd::CreatePoint(void * iDummy)
{
  ... // Include here the code to create the first 3D point 
  _daIndication-&gt;InitializeAcquisition(); // Recycle dialog agent
  return TRUE;
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>The <code>CreateLine</code> method creates the line. It takes the start
    point as argument and retrieves the end point from the dialog agent.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CATBoolean CAADegCreateLineCmd::CreateLine(void * iData)
{
  ... // Include here the code to create the line
}
...</pre>

</ol>

<h4><a name="360000"></a>Providing the Command Resources</h4>
<p>The command resources are the prompts displayed in the status bar for each
state. They are stored in the CAADegCreateLineCmd.CATNls file located in your
framework's CNext\resources\msgcatalog directory. This file contains the
following prompts, associated with the identifiers set for each states in <a href="#330000">Defining
End User Input</a>:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CAADegCreateLineCmd.stStartPointId.Message = &quot;Click to indicate the first point&quot;;
CAADegCreateLineCmd.stEndPointId.Message   = 
&quot;Move the mouse and click to indicate the second point&quot;;</pre>

<h3><a name="400000"></a>Integrating the Line Command into the Application</h3>
<p>The Line command is integrated into the application by following these steps:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#410000">Create the Line command creation function</a> in the CAADegCreateLineCmd.cpp file</li>
  <li><a href="#420000">Create a command header</a> for the Line command and put
    it in a workshop, a workbench, or an add-in to the appropriate workshop or
    workbench. You will find information in The Command Headers and in Creating
    a Workshop for Your Document, Creating Workbenches, and Adding Commands to
    Existing Workshops and Workbenches</li>
  <li><a href="#430000">Provide the command header resources</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="410000"></a>Creating the Line Command Creation Function</h4>
<p>The <code>CATCreateClass</code> macro inserted in the command class CAADegCreateLineCmd.cpp file creates a creation function for the Line command. This
enables the command class to be instantiated by the application using a command
header. This macro is provided by the CATCreateExternalObject.h header file.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
#include &quot;CATCreateExternalObject.h&quot;
CATCreateClass(CAADegCreateLineCmd);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="420000"></a>Creating the Line Command Header</h4>
<p>The command header class should be created in the chosen workshop, workbench,
or add-in class using the <code>MacDeclareHeader</code> macro. The command
header is an instance of this class created in the <code>CreateCommands</code>
method of the workshop, workbench, or add-in class. Then the command header is
associated with a command starter and arranged with the other commands in the <code>CreateWorkshop</code>,
<code>CreateWorkbench</code>, or <code>CreateToolbars</code> method of the
workshop, workbench, or add-in class respectively.</p>
<p>The Line command header is created in the Geometry workshop. <code>MacDeclareHeader</code>
creates the CAAGeometryHeader class for the header file, and this class is
instantiated in the <code>CreateCommands</code> method. It is then put in the
Insert menu, associated with a command starter and arranged after the Point
command in the <code>CreateWorkshop</code> method, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATCommandHeader.h&quot;
MacDeclareHeader(CAAGeometryHeader);
...
void Geometry::CreateCommands()
{
  ...
  new CAAGeometryHeader(&quot;Line&quot;,                  // Command header identifier
                        &quot;CATDegEduGeometryCmd&quot;,  // Command shared library or DLL
                        &quot;CAADegCreateLineCmd&quot;,      // Command class
                        (void *) NULL);          // Argument to pass to the command
  ...
}
...
CATCmdWorkshop * Geometry::CreateWorkshop()      
{
  ...
  NewAccess(CATCmdStarter,pLineInsert,LineInsert);
  SetAccessCommand(pLineInsert,&quot;Line&quot;);
  SetAccessNext(pPointInsert,pLineInsert);
  ...
}</pre>

  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="430000"></a>Providing the Line Command Header Resources</h4>
<p>You should now provide the resources for the command header. They are stored
in files located in your framework's CNext\resources\msgcatalog directory. The
resource keys are built using the command header class name concatenated to the
command header identifier using a dot, that is, <code>CAAGeometryHeader.Line</code>,
concatenated to other keywords depending on the resources. These resources
include:
<ul>
  <li>The command name, tooltip, help displayed in the status bar, and long help
    displayed in a box using the keywords <code>Title</code>, <code>ShortHelp</code>,
    <code>Help</code>, and <code>LongHelp</code> respectively. They are stored
    in the CAAGeometryHeader.CATNls file.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAAGeometryHeader.Line.Title     = &quot;Line&quot; ;
CAAGeometryHeader.Line.ShortHelp = &quot;Line&quot; ;
CAAGeometryHeader.Line.Help      = &quot;Creates lines: indicate 2 points&quot; ;
CAAGeometryHeader.Line.LongHelp  = &quot;Line (Insert menu)
Create lines:
 1- Indicate the first point:
    click with the left button: a cross appears 
 2- Indicate the second point:
    click with the left button: the cross disappears and the line is created.&quot;;
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>The command icon to be used in toolbars or in front of the command name in
    menus. This is the first icon set with the <code>Icon.Normal</code> keyword. This
    is stored in the CAAGeometryHeader.CATRsc file, and the icon files are
    stored in the CNext\resources\graphic\icons directory as bmp files.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAAGeometryHeader.Line.Icon.Normal    = &quot;I_EduLine&quot;;

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>A state dialog command is a dialog command designed as a state machine, each
state enabling end user input, that enables the end user to pass from state to
state using transitions between these states triggered when requested events
happen and when requested guard conditions are satisfied, and that execute the
declared actions. It is modeled using a class deriving from the CATStateCommand
class.</p>
<p>The statechart diagram is implemented using the <code>BuildGraph</code>
method, and the command life cycle is managed by the <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>,
and <code>Cancel</code> methods in addition to the command class constructor and
destructor.</p>

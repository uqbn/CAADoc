<h3><a name="A00000"></a>Managing Undo/Redo</h3>
<p>Undo/redo is managed at two levels:
<ol>
  <li>Input undo/redo</li>
  <li>Command undo/redo.</li>
</ol>
<p>Input undo/redo is available for the current state dialog command only. It
enables the end user to successively undo each input, that is to cancel previous
input and associated action to restore the document content as it was in each
state the command passes through, up to the beginning of the command, and of
course to redo, that is to replay canceled input and execute associated actions
up to the state where the undo began. If successive undos reach the initial
state, the command is deleted and the default command, usually Select, becomes
the current one. Command undo/redo takes place to undo previous command global
effects, up to the last recorded command. Each command can also be redone in one
step, except the command that was current when the end user began to undo, since
it was not completed and its effect was not recorded.</p>
<p>An object undo/redo can be added to both input and command undo/redo. It is
available when the object created or modified by the state dialog command
implements the <em>CATIUndoTransaction</em> interface. In this case, the object
manages itself its own undo/redo.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="A10000"></a>Input Undo/Redo without Object Undo/Redo</h4>
<p>The state dialog command records an input history that allows the end user to
undo previous input up to its initial state. Since an input is most of the time
an agent valuation, an input usually triggers a transition, and if the guard
condition evaluates True, the transition fires and executes an action. Whe the
end user clicks Undo, the state dialog command reverses this transition to
restore the transition's source state and unvaluates the dialog agent. To
reverse the transition, an undo action must be associated with the transition.
The dialog agent unvaluation is automatic. In the same way, to enable for redo,
that is, to take again the input into account, and restores the transition's
final state, a redo action must be associated with the transition.</p>
<p>As a result, you must provide an undo action for each action in order to
restore the document as it was in the previous state, and a redo action to redo
what is undone, along with the corresponding methods.</p>
<p>The undo and redo action methods are declared using the second and third
parameters of the <code>Action</code> method. For example, the transition
between two states of a state dialog command that creates triangles could be.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
AddTransition(stStartState,
              stSecondState,
              AndCondition(
                 IsOutputSetCondition(_daPathElement),
                 Condition((ConditionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::CheckPoint1)),
              Action( 
                 (ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::CreatePoint,
                 (ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::UndoCreatePoint,
                 (ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::RedoCreatePoint)) ;
...    </pre>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="A20000"></a>Input Undo/Redo with Object Undo/Redo</h4>
<p>In this case, the object(s) modified by the command implement the <em>CATIUndoTransaction</em>
interface and manage themselves their undo and redo. As a result, the action
methods you provide for undo/redo must not modify them. You can provide these
methods as in <a href="#A10000">Input Undo/Redo without Object Undo/Redo</a>.
They are executed before the undo and redo methods of the <em>CATIUndoTransaction</em>
interface. You can also create the action using the <code>Action</code> method,
and use the <code>SetBeforeUndo</code> and <code>SetBeforeRedo</code> methods.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
MyAction = Action((ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::CreatePoint);
MyAction-&gt;SetBeforeUndo((ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::BeforeUndoCreatePoint);
MyAction-&gt;SetBeforeRedo((ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::BeforeRedoCreatePoint);
...
AddTransition(stStartState,
              stSecondState,<u>
</u>              AndCondition(
                 IsOutputSetCondition(_daPathElement),
                 Condition((ConditionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::CheckPoint1)),
              MyAction);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Since the action is created using the <code>Action</code> method, it is
automatically deleted by the state dialog command.</p>
<p>Additional undo and redo methods can be executed after the undo/redo methods
of the <em>CATIUndoTransaction</em> interface. They are declared using&nbsp;the <code>SetAfterUndo</code>
and <code>SetAfterRedo</code> methods.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
MyAction-&gt;SetAfterUndo((ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::AfterUndoCreatePoint);
MyAction-&gt;SetAfterRedo((ActionMethod) &amp; CAACreateTriangleCmd::AfterRedoCreatePoint);

<h4><a name="A30000"></a>Command Undo/Redo without Object Undo/Redo</h4>
<p>A command history is managed for command undo/redo. This makes it possible to
cancel the effects of the last state dialog commands recorded in this history,
and to redo them. For example, the Point command undo deletes the point created,
and its redo recreates the deleted point. To make this possible, the command
should provide an undo/redo object, instance of the <i>CATCommandGlobalUndo</i>
class, using the <code>GetGlobalUndo</code> method overridden from the <i>CATStateCommand</i>
class. This undo/redo object has, as function members, the methods to be called
when the command undo or redo is requested by the end&nbsp; user, and a method
to manage the memory used. The <code>GetGlobalUndo</code> method is called when
the command completes to put the undo/redo object in the command history ready
for use.</p>
<p>Command undo/redo is illustrated using a command that creates a triangle.</p>

<h5><a name="A31000"></a>Providing the Global Undo Object</h5>
<p>This is possible by overriding the <code>GetGlobalUndo</code> method to

<p>The undo/redo can be managed for each end user input and for the whole
command. If the used object implements the <i>CATIUndoTransaction</i> interface,
it manages its own undo/redo by itself, and the methods that implement undo/redo
don't need to deal with object undo/redo. Otherwise, they do.</p>
<p>The input undo/redo takes place as long as the command is active, and
undo/redo methods are provided for each transition. The command undo redo is
implemented in a <i>CATGlobalUndoRedo</i> class instance to which pointers to
the appropriate undo/redo methods are passed.</p>

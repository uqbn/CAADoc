<h3><a name="100000"></a>Why Commands?</h3>
<p>The high-level interactivity proposed by CAA requires that the basic
interactive mechanisms be processed efficiently and consistently. These
interactive mechanisms make it possible to:
<ul>
  <li>Propose to the end user the appropriate tools to do intended tasks,
    possibly using different ways</li>
  <li>Provide appropriate dialog sequences to do and undo any kind of simple or
    complex task</li>
  <li>Manage the end user intent from the mouse click to the active command</li>
  <li>Enable document object access and update</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two items illustrate a part of the Model View Controller (MVC)
paradigm. CAA offers an object that provides these mechanisms as its behavior:
the CAA command. It is the key object to make up the CAA User Interface Model
interactive.</p>

<h3><a name="200000"></a>What Is a CAA Command?</h3>
<p>A CAA command is an instance of a class deriving from the CATCommand class
and that supports these interactive mechanisms:
<ul>
  <li>Propose to the end user the appropriate tools to do intended tasks,
    possibly using different ways
    <ul>
      <li>Commands are shown in menus and toolbars [<a href="#References">1</a>]
        and can be triggered and executed from there</li>
      <li>Commands are encapsulated by the direct manipulation</li>
      <li>Commands can be triggered by the object's contextual menu</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide appropriate dialog sequences to do and undo any kind of simple or
    complex task
    <ul>
      <li>Commands are instances of different command classes to allow the
        application programmer to create and cover all possible kinds of tasks</li>
      <li>Commands feature a global and a local undo mechanisms to make it
        possible to recover a previous document state among the successive
        document states, as if they were stacked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Manage the end user intent from the mouse click to the active command
    <ul>
      <li>Command instances build a run time parent/child tree structure</li>
      <li>Commands use the Send/Receive notification protocol [<a href="#References">2</a>]
        along this tree structure to convey notifications created by end user
        interactions to the appropriate command</li>
      <li>Command use a callback mechanism based on the Send/Receive
        notification protocol, or on typed events, with a callback manager set
        by default on each command, to enable the appropriate command to receive
        only the notifications that it can process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enable document object access and update
    <ul>
      <li>Commands use a protocol to access document objects&nbsp;through their
        selected representation in a view</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="300000"></a>CAA Command Typology</h3>
<p>CAA commands fall into the following categories:
<ul>
  <li>Commands seen by the end user as commands and referred to as <em>dialog
    commands</em>. These dialog commands can be:
    <ul>
      <li><em>One-shot commands</em> that are run with no possible additional
        choice from the end user. The class of a one-shot command should
        directly derive from the <i>CATCommand</i> class</li>
      <li><em>Dialog boxes</em> [<a href="#References">3</a>] that enable the
        end user to enter parameter values or select options. The class of a
        dialog box class should derive from the <i>CATDlgDialog</i> class</li>
      <li><em>State dialog commands</em> [<a href="#References">4</a>]: they are
        built as state machines, to make up high level dialog commands with
        states and transitions between these states. The class of a state dialog
        command should derive from the <i>CATStateCommand</i> class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These dialog commands are available to the end user through menu items in
    the menu bar, icons or combos in toolbars, or menu items in objects'
    contextual menus. They are triggered thanks to a command starter that stands
    for the command behind the push item in the menu bar or push button
    featuring an icon in a toolbar. This command starter is associated with a
    command header that holds the command class name and the shared library or
    DLL containing the command executable code. As soon as the end user clicks
    the push item or icon, the link is made with the corresponding command
    starter that requests the command header to load the appropriate shared
    library or DLL and instantiates the command class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Commands seen by the end user, but either
    <ul>
      <li>Not seen as commands, such as a control in a dialog box, or a dialog
        box part of a state command</li>
      <li>Implicitly handled using the object direct manipulation, such as
        manipulators.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>One-shot Commands</h4>
<p>These are commands that are run from their beginning to their end from a
single user interaction, with no means to stop them. Their dialog is limited to
selecting the push item or the icon in a toolbar that represent them, and can
display a confirmation dialog before proceeding.</p>
<h4>Dialog Box Commands</h4>
<p>These are commands that appear to the end user as a dialog box.&nbsp;The
dialog box is the command itself, rather than being part of another command. The
dialog sequence is limited to entering parameter values, or selecting options,
and clicking push buttons such as OK, Apply, or Cancel.</p>
<h4>State Dialog Commands</h4>
<p>These are commands modeled as state machines. They can have several states.
Each state lets the end user select objects, enter parameters, or choose
options. Transitions depend on conditions set on what the end user selects,
enters, or chooses. If these conditions are met, transitions trigger actions
when skipping to the next state to progress to the command completion. Dialog
boxes can be used to allow for parameter or option input.</p>

<h3><a name="400000"></a>The Command Tree Structure</h3>
<p>At run time, most of the CAA commands make a tree structure. Each command is
usually created with a parent command (or father command), either passed as a
parameter in the command class constructor, or using the <i> CATCommand</i> base class
constructor, or possibly set or reset using the <i>CATCommand</i> <code>SetFather</code>
method. This parent has itself a parent, and so on up to the root of the tree
named the command selector, a specific command that manages the availability and
life cycle of dialog commands. Commands created without a parent, that is with a
NULL parent, have automatically the command selector as parent. The figure below
is a view of a CAA session as its command tree structure.</p>
<table border="0">
<caption>Fig.1: The Command Tree Structure</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAAfrUnderstandingLayout9.jpg" width="586" height="491"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This figure shows that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the top of the command tree, there is a <i>CATCommandSelector</i> class
    instance created by the V5 application. It is the parent of commands with
    NULL as parent if there is no current editor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Each editor which controls the visualization of a document [<a href="#References">5</a>]
    creates a <i>CATCommandSelector</i> class instance whose the parent is the
    top command selector. This command selector is itself the parent (
    CATCommand sense) of:
    <ul>
      <li>All the windows of the document (<i>CATFrmWindow </i>class instances),</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Commands created with NULL as parent.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  <li>A dialog box, dependent of the document's life cycle, is created under a
    decorator. This decorator is created it self by the editor of the document.
    Whereas, a dialog box, independent of the document's life cycle, is created
    under the <i>CATApplicationDocument</i> class instance. It is an unique
    instance returned by the <code>GetApplicationDocument</code> method of the <i>CATApplicationFrame</i>
    class [<a href="#References">5</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>The dialog command seen by the end user and that is currently running is
named the active command. It is said to have the focus, one command being active
at a given instant. The command selector manages the focus and gives it to, or
takes it from, the dialog commands that the end user selects.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAAAfrCommandTree2.gif" alt="CAAAfrCommandTree2.gif (21264 bytes)" width="711" height="279"></p>
<p>The command tree structure is used to convey end user intents from the object
that detects the event up to the object that is able to process it. This is
devoted to the Send/Receive notification protocol. For example, in a dialog box,
the OK push button is a command created as a child of the dialog box itself, or
as one of its subcommands, such as an invisible frame that groups the OK, Apply,
and Cancel push buttons. By setting a callback on the push button, the dialog
box expects to catch the end user intent when the end user will click OK. The
method executed when such an event occurs is a member function of the dialog box
class, declared as part of the callback.</p>
<p>The object selected by the end user can be something else than a command. For
example, in a viewer, an object representation is usually selected. In this
case, a manipulator, that is another form of a command, is associated with the
representation.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="500000"></a><a>Command Running Mode and Command Focus and Lifecycle
Management</a></h3>
<p>The command selector manages the focus between the commands. It receives the
notifications sent by commands below it to react to end user interactions that
climb up along the command tree structure and that were not caught and processed
by another command. It sends these notifications to the active command. To
enable this management, a dialog command has a running (or start) mode. It can
be set as:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclusive</strong>: an exclusive command is known by the command
    selector. It requests the command selector to clean the command stack before
    beginning to run and taking the focus, including the previous active
    command. All commands present in the stack are canceled, that is called on
    their <code>Cancel</code> method. Use <code>CATCommandModeExclusive</code>
    to set a command as exclusive</li>
  <li><strong>Shared</strong>: a shared command is known by the command
    selector. It coexists with other commands already present in the stack, and
    requests the command selector to deactivate the active command before it
    takes the focus. Use <code>CATCommandModeShared</code> to set a command as
    shared.</li>
  <li><strong>Undefined</strong>: an undefined command is unknown by the command
    selector. It can run in parallel with the active command known by the
    command selector. Use <code>CATCommandModeUndefined</code> to set a command
    as undefined. Note that a state dialog command cannot be set as undefined.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>A dialog command known by the command selector, that is created either as
exclusive or shared, is managed by the command selector using the three methods <code>Activate</code>,
<code>Desactivate</code>, and <code>Cancel</code>. As a general rule, these
methods do the following:
<ul>
  <li><code>Activate</code> is called when the dialog command takes the focus,
    if it is set as an exclusive or shared command. This happens in three cases:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The command is just selected by the end user. The command class is
      instantiated and the dialog starts from the beginning</li>
    <li>The command is a state dialog command in repeat mode. Each time the
      command completes, it resumes from the beginning</li>
    <li>The command restarts at the state that was current when a shared command
      took the focus from it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><code>Activate</code> can be used to create temporary objects that are
  needed from the beginning, either because they help the end user to perform
  the command, such as the outline of the created object, or a rubber band that
  follows the mouse, both known as interactive objects and added to the set of
  interactive objects (ISO), or construction objects that can be helpful.</p>
  <li><code>Desactivate</code> is called when a shared command takes the focus
    from the active command. The active command becomes inactive, is frozen in
    its current state and put in the command stack. When the shared command will
    complete, the frozen command will be reactivated from its current state
    using the <code>Activate</code> method. <code>Desactivate</code> should hide
    temporary objects created by <code>Activate</code>, or by the action
    methods, such as a dialog box, or temporary interactive objects that should
    be removed from the ISO. Some objects should be deleted, such as the rubber
    band, that will never be restored as it were since it follows the mouse.</li>
  <li><code>Cancel</code> is called when the command completes if it is a state
    dialog command, or when an exclusive command takes the focus and requests
    the command to be deleted. When the command completes, the focus is given to
    the default command (usually Select). <code>Cancel</code> must delete or
    release temporary objects created by the command, possibly after having
    removed them from the ISO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows a summary of when these methods are called, and
what they should contain, depending on the command type and running mode.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>The CAA commands are key objects to provide interactivity. They can have the
one-shot, dialog boxes, or state dialog command type, depending from their base
class. They can run in exclusive, shared, or undefined mode depending on their
type.</p>
<p>Most of them build a tree structure at run time, used to convey notifications
emanating from end user interactions, up to the appropriate command, that is the
command able to perform the end user intent. The command at the top of the tree
structure, named the command selector, sends orphan notifications to the active
command and manages the command focus thanks to the <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>,
and <code>Cancel</code> methods that each command should override.</p>

<h3><a name="300000"></a>Managing the State Dialog Command Lifecycle</h3>
<p>The command lifecycle is managed using the constructor and the destructor,
and using the three methods <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>, and
<code>Cancel</code>.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="310000"></a>Constructor</h4>
<p>The command constructor instantiates the command class. It should instantiate
or retrieve the command class data members, or retrieve the pointers to the
appropriate interfaces set as data members, that should be created once during
the command lifecycle, and that are required at the beginning of the command.</p>
<p>Using the constructor, and using the <i>CATStateCommand</i> constructor, you
can also manage the command running mode and possibly the argument passed to the
command from the command header:
<ul>
  <li>The command running (or start) mode, that can be set as the second
    argument of the <i>CATStateCommand</i> constructor, as:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exclusive</strong>: an exclusive command is known by the
        command selector. It requests the command selector to clean the command
        stack before beginning to run and taking the focus, including the active
        command. All commands present in the stack are deleted. Use <code>CATCommandModeExclusive</code>
        to set a command as exclusive</li>
      <li><strong>Shared</strong>: a shared command is known by the command
        selector. It coexists with other commands already present in the stack,
        and requests the command selector to deactivate the active command
        before it takes the focus. Use <code>CATCommandModeShared</code> to set
        a command as shared.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/warning.gif" alt="warning.gif (206 bytes)" width="30" height="30">
    A state dialog command cannot be set as an undefined command.</p>
    <p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" alt="information.gif (174 bytes)" width="31" height="30">
    A command that creates, modifies, or updates data in the document should
    always be declared as an <strong>exclusive</strong> command. A shared
    command, that is, a command that may interrupt another command, should never
    modify the document, because if it does so, when the previous command
    resumes after the shared command completion, this command may not found what
    it has left when interrupted. Any command should properly manage its
    interruptions using the <code>Desactivate</code> method called when a shared
    command takes the focus. The interrupted command should make the assumption
    that the interrupting command doesn't modify the document. Any command
    should also properly manage its deletion using the <code>Cancel</code>
    method called when an exclusive command takes the focus.</p>
    <p>For example, the <i>CAACommandCmd</i> command is set as exclusive, as
    shown below.</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAACommandCmd::CAACommandCmd()
             : CATStateCommand(&quot;CommandId&quot;, <strong>CATCommandModeExclusive</strong>), ...
{
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Note that the exclusive mode is the default mode, and that consequently, <code>CATCommandModeExclusive</code>
    could be removed from the <i>CATStateCommand</i> constructor arguments.
    Whatever its mode, such a command should have a creation function. It can
    then be proposed to the end user through a menu item or a toolbar, that is,
    using a command header that uses this creation function to create the
    command instance when the end user clicks on the menu item or on the icon in
    the toolbar. This creation function is itself created using the <code>CATCreateClass</code>
    macro, as shown below.</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
#include &quot;CATCreateExternalObject.h&quot;
CATCreateClass(CAACommandCmd);
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The argument passed to the command from the command header as a pointer to
    an object. This is the case when different menu items or icons seem to run
    different commands through different command headers, but really activate
    the same command class by passing an argument to the command class
    constructor to differentiate from where the input comes, and to execute
    accordingly.
    <p>For example, the state dialog command <i>CAACmdWithArg</i> is passed an
    argument as a pointer to a <i>CATUnicodeString</i> from its different
    command headers, as shown below.</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CAACmdWithArg::CAACmdWithArg(<u>CATUnicodeString</u> * iArg)
             : CATStateCommand(&quot;CommandId&quot;, ...
{
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Such a command should have its creation function created using the <code>CATCreateClassArg</code>
    macro, as shown below, with the intended pointer type passed as the second
    argument.</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
#include &quot;CATCreateExternalObject.h&quot;
CATCreateClassArg(CAACmdWithArg, CATUnicodeString);
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Note that any kind of pointer can be passed in place of <i>CATUnicodeString</i>.
    The same type should be declared in both the command constructor and
    the&nbsp; <code>CATCreateClassArg</code> macro.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="320000"></a>Destructor</h4>
<p>You should explicitly delete or release the data members created or retrieved
once for the command, usually in the constructor or in the <code>BuildGraph</code>
method, such as the dialog agents, compared to the data members created in the <code>Activate</code>
method that should generally be deleted in the <code>Cancel</code> method.</p>
<p>Any state, transition, condition, or action created in <code>BuildGraph</code>
using the methods proposed by the <i>CATStateCommand</i> class are automatically
deleted. These methods are:
<ul>
  <li>States: <code>GetInitiaState</code>, <code>AddDialogState</code>, <code>GetCancelState</code></li>
  <li>Transitions: <code>AddTransition</code></li>
  <li>Conditions: <code>Condition</code>, <code>IsOutputSetCondition</code>, <code>IsLastModifiedAgentCondition</code>
    <code>AndCondition</code>, <code>OrCondition</code>, <code>NotCondition</code></li>
  <li>Actions: <code>Action</code>, <code>AndAction</code>, <code>OrAction</code></li>
</ul>
<p>On the opposite, any state (<i>CATDialogState</i>), transition (<i>CATDialogTransition</i>),
condition (<i>CATStateCondition</i>), or action (<i>CATDiaAction</i>) you
explicitly instantiate using its constructor should be deleted in the command
class destructor.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="330000"></a>Activate</h4>
<p><code>Activate</code> is called when the state dialog command takes the
focus. This happen in two cases:
<ol>
  <li>The command is just selected by the end user. The command class is
    instantiated and the dialog starts from the beginning</li>
  <li>The command restarts at the state that was current when a shared command
    took the focus from it.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>Activate</code> can be used to create temporary objects that are needed
from the beginning, either because they help the end user to perform the
command, such as the outline of the created object, or a rubber band that
follows the mouse, both known as interactive objects and added to the set of
interactive objects (ISO), or construction objects that can be helpful.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="340000"></a>Desactivate</h4>
<p><code>Desactivate</code> is called when a shared command takes the focus. The
active command becomes inactive, is frozen in its current state and put in the
command stack. When the shared command will complete, the frozen command will be
reactivated from its current state using the <code>Activate</code> method. <code>Desactivate</code>
should hide temporary objects created by <code>Activate</code>, or by the action
methods, such as a dialog box, or temporary interactive objects that should be
removed from the ISO. Some objects should be deleted, such as the rubber band,
that will never be restored as it were since it follows the mouse.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="350000"></a>Cancel</h4>
<p><code>Cancel</code> is called when the command completes, or when an
exclusive command takes the focus and requests the command to be deleted. When
the command completes, the focus is given to the default command (usually
Select). If the command was set as a repeatable, the focus is given to it again.
<code>Cancel</code> must delete or release temporary objects created by the
command, possibly after having removed them from the sets of objects. It should
also delete objects created in the action methods, or possibly in the condition
methods, even if this code could be put in the destructor, except if the command
were declared in repeat mode.</p>
<p>When the command is canceled, you can request the command undo when the
command completes by calling the <code>ExecuteUndoAtEnd</code> method.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the methods that go in pairs for
creation/destruction of the command objects.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>A dialog state command is a dialog command designed as a state machine, each
state enabling end user input, that enables the end user to pass from state to
state using transitions between these states triggered when requested events
happen and when requested guard conditions are satisfied, and that execute the
declared actions. It is modeled using a class deriving from the <i>CATStateCommand</i>
class.</p>
<p>The statechart diagram is implemented using the <code>BuildGraph</code>
method, and the command life cycle is managed by the <code>Activate</code>, <code>Desactivate</code>,
and <code>Cancel</code> methods in addition to the command class constructor and
destructor.</p>

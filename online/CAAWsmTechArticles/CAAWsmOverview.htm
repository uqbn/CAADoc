      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>SCM is a Software Configuration Management System designed for
      supporting CAA V5 developments. Throughout workspaces' features SCM
      provides a way for a company to organize and to control software
      developments between development departments.<br>
      The purpose of this paper is to present the main functionalities of the
      SCM system.

<h3><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h3>
<p>The SCM system was first designed for CAA V5 developers, that is numbers of
developers involved in the production of various software products. In such a
situation the main goal was to maximize reusability: A solution can be brought
by a good component-oriented design but when hundreds of developers need these
components, you quickly need to control how they operate: this is the role of
SCM and its workspace management.</p>
<table width="100%">

      </table>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">From the CAA V5 point of view the benefits of
      component-oriented design are the followings:
      <ul>
        <li>a large application can be broken down into manageable pieces</li>
        <li>little applications as well as large developments can be dispatched
          among numbers of little teams.</li>

    <td width="50%">Using SCM, concurrent engineering and integration become
      easier to bring into operation
      <p>SCM is just one part of CAA V5 RADE, there are other tools which
      contribute to the software production by helping the users to build, run,
      test, document their programs. Each of them can be seen - and used - as an
      independent tool but sharing a common concept: the components. While other
      tools are designed for operating on a given file tree without any exchange
      between different file trees, the SCM purpose is to help people work and
      share components in a cooperative development process.</p>
      <p>In the figure 2, one can see that
      <ul>
        <li>different components exist on different hosts</li>
        <li>same components exist on different hosts</li>
        <li>components are delivered from hosts to hosts for an integration
          purpose</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these functionalities are provided by SCM which allows people to
      get a copy of components, to work on them and to deliver them.</td>

<h3><a name="WorkspaceConcept"></a>The Workspace Concept</h3>
<p>Like the file tree is the foundation of most CAA V5 tools, the <b>workspace</b>
is the main concept of SCM.</p>

    </td>
    <td width="50%">The workspace [<a href="#References">1</a>] is a database
      object having a name and owning a set of components : in CAA V5
      development world, components are named <b>frameworks</b> and have
      internal components named code <b>modules</b> and <b>data</b> modules. The
      code module is dedicated to source files while the data module contains
      various files such as resources (message files, icons, etc).
      <p>Using SCM, the unit of copy is the framework: if one user wants to work
      on some specific files, he cannot access directly these files but rather
      gets a copy of the whole component these files belong to. This ensures
      that the user will have a complete environment to test his/her
      modifications.</p>
      <p>A set of components being available, any workspace is allowed to get a
      copy of any component. As shown in the figure 3, the number and names of
      components belonging to a workspace may vary from one workspace to another
      one.</td>

      <p>If two workspaces share at least one component (i.e. having a copy of

<h4><a name="The workspace image"></a>The Workspace Image</h4>
<p>A workspace is created by one user and any user may have several workspaces.</p>
<p>As explained before, the workspace object is managed in the SCM repository
and this object owns a set of components. However, what is interesting for the
developer is to have those components on his/her machine.</p>
<p>The copies of components (files and directories) is made concrete by the use
of <b>images</b>. From the user point of view, one image is identified by a root
directory under which all frameworks he/she is working on are projected from the
SCM repository. Files and directories are created automatically by SCM regarding
the frameworks belonging to the workspace. Like the other CAA V5 development
tools, SCM manages a particular file tree:
<ul>
  <li>frameworks are directories under the image root directory</li>
  <li>modules are directories under each framework directory</li>
  <li>public header files are gathered under &quot;PublicInterfaces&quot;
    directory right under each framework directory</li>
  <li>source files are gathered under &quot;src&quot; directory under each
    module directory</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Using SCM, the developer will use the same file tree as the one he might have
learned using other CAA V5 development tools.</p>

<h4><a name="Files rather than"></a>Files Rather than Objects</h4>
<p>Like any configuration system, users' files are represented in SCM
repositories by object identifiers. However, all user commands take files and
directories as parameters, this eases learning and use of the system. In a same
way, any information displayed by commands are user oriented.<br>
Object identifiers can be displayed or used by some administration commands
operating directly on database objects.</p>

<h4><a name="Version control"></a>Version Control</h4>
<p>SCM manages versions of any objects in a workspace: frameworks, modules,
directories and files. SCM provides commands for creating, modifying or removing
frameworks, modules, directories or files and any action is recorded into the
database.</p>

    <td width="50%">Versions of compound objects (components, directories) are

<p>In fact, even if version management exists in SCM, there is no user commands
for accessing them. We consider that the developer does not need to manipulate
versions of files but simply files. The usual view on a software is the file
system view which is a flat view while a versioning system offers a deeper view.
Sometimes it is interesting to access the history of an object but most often
the last state is the best one.</p>
<p>Using SCM and its workspace management, users do not manipulate directly
versions of files and directories but rather the &quot;current&quot; state of
them: the best state. Of course, when a development is under way, files are not
always good, that's why the workspace is an isolated place from which new
versions of objects cannot be retrieved without its owner's needs. New versions
are available only when the workspace delivers them (send them to a specific
workspace) or publish them (make them available for others workspaces).</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Configuration control"></a>Configuration Control</h4>
<p>Configuration management is the ability to group simple objects in compound
objects and to manage the composition evolution all along the object life.<br>
In SCM, there are five kinds of compound objects (or configuration objects):
<ul>
  <li>The workspace: it is composed of frameworks and the different versions of
    a workspace correspond to different versions of frameworks or different sets
    of frameworks present in the workspace at a given time.</li>
  <li>The framework: this is the top level of objects managed in a workspace. It
    is composed of files, directories and modules and its different versions
    corresponds to different versions of files, directories, modules or
    different sets of modules belonging to the framework at a given time.</li>
  <li>The module: its an object composed of files and directories and its
    versions corresponds to different versions of files and directories.</li>
  <li>The directory: it is defined by a path and a content and its versions
    corresponds to different locations (path) and different contents (in term of
    set of files or versions of files).</li>
  <li>The file: it's the finest grain of objects that can be managed in a
    workspace. Its versions correspond to different contents, locations or
    attributes (execution rights, description, ...).</li>
</ul>
<p>SCM provides commands for managing each kind of these objects and the
composition is maintained by the system.<br>
For example:
<ul>
  <li>Getting a copy of one component (framework, module) will retrieve all the
    files and directories belonging to this component. SCM copes with creation,
    move or deletion of directories and files when updating the user's file
    system.</li>
  <li>Creating a new file somewhere in the file tree will cause the new file to
    be automatically added to the set of files belonging to the embedding
    component.</li>
  <li>Delivering a workspace causes all components belonging to this workspace
    to be delivered as well. If the target workspace does not contain some
    delivered components, they are automatically added into it.</li>
  <li>Getting last versions of components from another workspace will cause last
    versions of files and directories to be retrieved only for components
    currently managed in the target workspace. Different workspaces can share
    either the same components or a common subset.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Check-in/Check-out"></a>Check-in/Check-out</h4>
<p>Check-in and Check-out are the basic actions offered by all Software
Configuration Management systems:
<ul>
  <li>Check-out a file means that the file is acquired by the user for
    modification.</li>
  <li>Check-in a file means that the file is saved in the database and a new
    version is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two operations are provided by SCM:
<ul>
  <li>The Check-out action is mandatory before modifying any file. This allows
    SCM to be aware of a modification and to maintain the set of modified files
    at a given time in a workspace.</li>
  <li>The Check-in action is provided as is or automatically performed by some
    commands when they operate on the user's file system (to avoid to lose
    unsaved modifications).</li>
</ul>
<p>Concurrent modifications are also managed by SCM, the defaults are:
<ul>
  <li>Any text file can be checked-out by any user</li>
  <li>Any binary file can be checked-out by only one user at a given time. Other
    users must wait for getting the last state of the file before being allowed
    to modify it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These defaults are set regarding the kind of file because two versions of a
text file can be merged to obtain a new version (integrating the two sets of
modifications) while a binary file cannot be merged (this requires particular
tools regarding the type of binary file: executable, resource file, document,
...).<br>
However these defaults can be overridden at check-out time.</p>

<h3><a name="Adele look"></a>How Does SCM Look Like?</h3>
<p>SCM is provided as a set of user commands and a set of administrator
commands. Installing SCM consists in setting up SCM databases and daemons on SCM
servers and installing user commands on each user hosts.<br>
A profile is given for setting up the user working environment.</p>
<p>SCM is available on Windows and Unix platforms 
and the commands and the way to use them are exactly the same on all platforms.
The available commands are listed in the Command Reference page [<a href="#References">2</a>],
classified by topics (workspace management, framework management, etc.).</p>
<p>SCM commands can be integrated in various applications by calling them and
treating commands' outputs.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>SCM is a configuration system which manages CAA V5 components (frameworks,
modules) inside workspaces. Workspaces are database objects organized in trees
whose purpose is to control data exchanges between users. Users work on files on
their personal file systems and interact with each others by commands involving
the whole workspace.</p>

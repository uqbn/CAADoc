<h3><a name="Workspaces"></a>Workspaces</h3>
<p>The workspace is the place where the user is working on. As a space designed
for CAA V5 developments, the workspace contains CAA components (frameworks,
modules) along with their files. Any work performed inside a workspace is
completely isolated from outer changes. Conversely, any development is delivered
only at user needs.</p>
<p>Each workspace is dedicated to one user and any user may have several
workspaces. A workspace has two representations within the SCM system: one
inside a central repository and another one on the user file system.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">
      <table>
        <caption>Fig 1: the Logical View of a Workspace</caption>

    <td width="50%">This figure shows a workspace object containing three
      frameworks having different modules.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>A workspace is identified by a unique name given at creation time and that
can be used afterwards for choosing the current working workspace.</p>
<p>Inside the SCM repository, workspaces can be seen as configurations, that is
to say objects composed of components (themselves composed of files) and having
different states all along their lives. Each of these states is known as
revision or version of workspace. SCM manages workspaces as a whole. The data
flow between workspaces involves on all components seen in the workspaces. In
addition, data flows operate inside the SCM repository and what users see is the
projection of the result of these flows on their file systems.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Images"></a>Images</h3>
<p>Images are the concrete representation of workspaces on users' hosts and file
systems. Images are associated with workspaces and are identified by a name
(optional) and a root directory. A first image can be created at the same time a
new workspace is created and multiple images can be created or deleted all along
the workspace's life.</p>
<p>Inside an image (so somewhere under the image root directory), the user works
on files using his/her usual tools and editors and interact with SCM databases
using SCM commands. The file tree whose root directory is the image root
directory is not directly managed by SCM. For instance, new files can be created
and edited without interaction with the SCM system and they can be declared to
SCM only before delivering them. In a same way, modifying a file already
declared to SCM means to execute a &quot;check-out&quot; command in order to
register the action of modification and then there is no more interaction with
SCM during the file editing.</p>
<p>The figure 2 shows the two representations of a workspace:
<ul>
  <li>the left side is the database view with a workspace containing frameworks
    having modules</li>
  <li>the right side shows the content of one image of this workspace, that is a
    file tree where frameworks and modules are directories.</li>
  <li>the file tree contains various files and directories: source files are
    managed by SCM while programs and code objects are generated by other tools.</li>
</ul>
<table>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/FileTree2.gif" width="600" height="300"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>A workspace can have from 0 to n images. The most usual way of working with
images is to have two images: one on Windows platform and the other one on
Unix platform. Therefore it is easy to develop on one platform and test the same
development on the other one. When only one image exists on one platform for a
given workspace, it is not needed to name it (default names being WINDOWS and
UNIX). Otherwise, when more than one image exist on one platform, they must be
named by the user and their names must be given when selecting the current
working image (along with the current working workspace).</p>
<p>SCM allows users to modify different files in different images of the same
workspace at the same time. However, it is not allowed to modify the same file
in two images of the same workspace. This restriction has been set to limit the
number of merges that can occur in a workspace. Remember that images are just
projections of one workspace, so they share the same objects, not copies of
them.</p>
<p>If different developments should be done on the same components at the same
time, the usual process should be to create two different workspaces for the
different developments (there is no limitation on the number of workspaces per
user).</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Multiplatforms"></a>Multiplatform Workspaces</h3>
<p>As explained above, any workspace can have several images on different hosts.
For instance, if one application must be developed on Windows, AIX and SunOS,
workspaces involved in this development can have two images:
<ul>
  <li>one on Windows operating system</li>
  <li>one on AIX/SunOS operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not needed to create one image on an AIX machine and another one on a
SunOS machine because, thanks to NFS, the same file tree (image) can be used for
compiling and testing programs. Note that other CAA V5 tools can operate on the
same file tree from various Unix operating systems.<br>
</p>
<p>The figure 3 shows multiple images of two workspaces:</p>

<h3><a name="Trees"></a>Workspace Trees</h3>
<p>Workspaces are created in a top-down fashion and by the way are organized in
trees.</p>
<p>The tree purpose is to gather all workspaces involved in a common development
project and also to control how data are exchanged between workspaces.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">

    <td width="50%">A tree is specified:
      <ul>
        <li>by a name<br>

          an associated file server.<br>
          A repository dedicated to source files management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A tree contains workspaces created from the root workspace to leaf
      workspaces.</p>
      <p>Data exchanges are controlled within a tree:
      <ul>
        <li>a workspace can deliver its modifications only to the upper
          workspace</li>
        <li>a workspace can get components only from its upper workspace</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When getting started with SCM, people must think of how they will work
together:
<ul>
  <li>how many products must be developed?</li>
  <li>how many teams are involved in each product?</li>
  <li>how various developments should be integrated?</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to answer to these questions, people know how many trees are
needed and how workspaces must be organized:
<ul>
  <li>components composing a product can be managed in a single tree</li>
  <li>products sharing no components can be managed in different trees</li>
  <li>teams involved in the development of a common product will create their
    workspaces in the same tree</li>
  <li>developers' workspaces will be leaves of trees while upper workspaces will
    be dedicated to integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notes</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Once created, a workspace cannot be moved in another place in the
    workspace tree</li>
  <li>A workspace can be created at any time under an existing workspace.</li>
</ul>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="The root workspace"></a>The Root Workspace</h4>
<p>The root workspace is the first workspace created in a new tree. As the
purpose of a tree is to gather all developments of a given product, the root
workspace has a special meaning:</p>
<table width="100%">

</table>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="The project"></a>The Project Workspace</h4>
<p>Except for the root workspace, all workspaces are created linked to an
existing workspace: the existing workspace is called the parent workspace and
the new workspace is called the child workspace.</p>
<table width="100%">

</table>
<p>Activities taking place in a project workspace are integration activities:
developments which have been performed &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; a
project workspace are integrated, possibly merged, tested and finally available
for others workspaces.</p>
<p>Another role is to get components or modifications from the parent workspace
to make them available for child workspaces. As a matter of fact, any user
willing to work on a component which is already managed by a workspace must
obtain a copy of this component from his parent workspace. Only data which are
managed in a workspace can be seen by child workspaces, so it's up to the
project manager to attach the needed components in his/her workspace.</p>
<p>The process is the same whatever the types of managed data are (source files,
documentation, tests, resources).</p>

<h4><a name="Multi-trees"></a>Multi-tree Workspaces</h4>
<p>The previous sections have explained how workspaces are organized in trees
and that workspaces involved in a same product development must be managed in a
common tree. However, a large product can be composed of well identified parts
that can be developed in different departments with different people
(infrastructure, GUI, etc). People involved in the development of each kind of
components need to get copies of these components but do not need to copy other
components. In such a case we can have several trees gathering the different
kinds of components, this reduces the set of components per tree. However it is
needed to control component deliveries, to integrate them (put all of them in a
same place and test the whole application). This is the purpose of the
multi-tree workspace.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center">
      <table>

      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The figure 8 shows three trees and two multi-tree workspaces: the
&quot;Int2&quot; workspace is defined in two trees and its purpose it to
integrate components delivered by &quot;Dev1&quot;, &quot;Dev2&quot;,
&quot;Dev3&quot; and &quot;Dev4&quot; workspaces. The &quot;Int1&quot; workspace
is defined in three trees and its purpose is to integrate components coming from
&quot;Int2&quot; and &quot;Int3&quot; workspaces.</p>
<p>It is easy to turn off/on the multi-tree characteristic:
<ul>
  <li>a new workspace can be created in several trees at the same time</li>
  <li>a workspace existing in a given tree can be defined in other trees</li>
  <li>a workspace can be &quot;removed&quot; from some trees at any time (under
    the condition it does not have any child workspace, otherwise the dataflow
    would be broken!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some characteristics of a multi-tree workspace:
<ul>
  <li>it has the same name in all trees, in other words, in two workspaces in
    two trees have the same name, they are the same multi-tree workspace</li>
  <li>it has the same images in all trees; all components being projected in the
    same place, this ease the compilation and tests of applications.</li>
  <li>all SCM dataflow commands operate on the whole workspace (so in all
    trees), by the way collects or deliveries of developments are performed in a
    single operation.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="The development process"></a>The Development Process</h3>
<p>The development process is the way people are working together by sharing and
delivering components.</p>
<p>Data exchanges are controlled by SCM through workspaces:
<ul>
  <li>Workspaces provide an isolated place for working on without being
    disturbed by outer changes</li>
  <li>People decide when their development are delivered or available for other
    people</li>
  <li>Data are delivered from a workspace to its parent workspace</li>
  <li>New changes of components are taken from the parent workspace</li>
</ul>
<p>SCM provides commands for managing the delivery of changes at a workspace
level, the user does not need to compute the set of changes to be delivered, SCM
does it for him/her by registering all actions performed during the development.</p>

<h3><a name="Site"></a>Site</h3>
<p>The site is a naming space where some objects have unique name. Within a
site:
<ul>
  <li>A tree has an unique name</li>
  <li>A workspace has an unique name</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for companies having multiple distant sites (over a WAN), there is
only one site managed by SCM.<br>
The whole site is controlled by a monitor whose purpose is to manage connections
between user commands and SCM servers:
<ul>
  <li>several servers and repositories can be set up for large companies</li>
  <li>different trees can be managed on different servers and in different
    repositories, SCM commands ask for connections to the different servers for
    treating multi-tree workspaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no user command for dealing with sites.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Modifications"></a>Modifications</h3>
<p>Modifications or changes are terms used in SCM for speaking about fine
modifications initially performed inside one workspace and propagated to the
other ones afterwards. There are different kinds of modifications and they can
applied on directories or files.</p>
<p>File modifications that are handled by SCM are:
<ul>
  <li>Creation: a new file is created</li>
  <li>Deletion: an existing file is deleted</li>
  <li>Edition: the file content is modified</li>
  <li>Move and/or renaming: the path to the file is changed</li>
  <li>Change of execution mode: this is an Unix feature, a file must have
    special rights to be executed</li>
</ul>
<p>Directory modifications that are handled by SCM are:
<ul>
  <li>Creation: a new directory is created</li>
  <li>Deletion: an existing directory is deleted</li>
  <li>Move and/or renaming: the path to the directory is changed</li>
</ul>
<p>SCM is able to manage those modifications independently for each other. It
means that messages displayed by dataflow commands may show different
modifications for one object (file or directory) and that concurrent
modifications are handled properly.</p>
<p>For instance, if one workspace changes the content of one file while another
one changes its location (and possibly its name), if these two workspaces
deliver their changes and they are collected at the same time, the result for
the file will be with the new content at the new location (possibly under the
new name).</p>
<p>The previous situation is not a conflicting situation. Sometimes the same
kind of modification is applied on the same object in different workspaces and
they have to be collected at the same time: SCM provides two ways to handle such
a situation, this is explained in the &quot;<a href="#Merges">Merges</a>&quot;
section.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Merges"></a>Merges</h3>
<p>A merge is a situation where two conflicting modifications must be applied on
the same object at the same time.<br>
For instance:
<ul>
  <li>a file content has been modified by two workspaces and they are collected
    at the same time</li>
  <li>the same file has been renamed to two different names by two workspaces
    and they are collected at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default process supported by SCM is to forbid a merging case at collect
time. To prevent this case, any promotion to a workspace is analyzed by SCM to
know if the change set contains at least one modification already promoted by
another workspace, if it happens, the promotion is canceled, giving to the user
the conflicting file(s) and modification(s). This user must wait for the other
promotion to be collected and published and then he/she can synchronize his/her
workspace to get the conflicting modification. This synchronization will lead to
a merge between the local modification and the other one.</p>
<p>The default process is to let developers solve merges because they should
have a better knowledge on file content than the user who is responsible of an
integration workspace.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of modifications for which SCM needs the user help and
for which a merging tool is provided:
<ul>
  <li>modification of file content: the two conflicting versions of the file are
    sent to graphical and interactive tool (The SCM Merger) which shows the
    content of the two versions and allows the user to select one version for
    each part being modified in the two versions.</li>
  <li>move/renaming of file: the paths to the different target locations are
    displayed and SCM prompts the user for entering the right path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the inconsistency caused by having two different modifications on the
same object at the same place (the workspace), the only action that an user can
perform when a merge occurs is to solve this merge.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Transactions"></a>Transactions</h3>
<p>Any SCM command is executed under transaction control, that means that
<ul>
  <li>if a command succeeds, everything is done</li>
  <li>if a command fails, all modifications are cancelled</li>
</ul>
<p>The transaction mechanism is provided by commands operating on files as well
as workspace commands.</p>
<p>Some commands group several transactions, in this case they can be
interrupted while executing: the current active transaction will be cancelled
but not the previous ones. In any case, sub-transactions correspond to SCM
commands and therefore they can be executed afterwards.</p>
<p>For instance:
<ul>
  <li>the command creating a workspace calls the command for creating an image.
    If the command is interrupted during the creation of the image, the
    workspace will still exist and the command for creating an image can be
    launched afterwards.</li>
  <li>the command synchronizing a workspace calls the command for refreshing the
    current image. Here again the synchronization command can be interrupted
    while refreshing the image. In this case, the workspace's status will be
    &quot;synchronized&quot; but the image's status will be &quot;not
    refreshed&quot;. The refresh command can be run to refresh the current image
    against the workspace content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows the traces of the adl_mk_ws command. The
&quot;Command successful&quot; messages indicate the end of a (sub)transaction.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>

<p>Users work in workspaces providing an isolated space for developing
components. The user view of a workspace is the image which is the projection of
files from this workspace. SCM registers user actions by the mean of
modifications. Workspaces are organized in trees and data are exchanged

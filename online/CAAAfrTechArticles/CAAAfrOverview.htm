 <h3><a name="100000"></a>The Anatomy of a Typical CAA V5 Application Window</h3>
 <p>The CAA V5 application window is the host for all CAA V5 documents. As an 
 MDI (Multiple Document Interface) application window, it can display several 
 document windows at the same time as child windows of its application window, 
 one document window, and thus one document, being active at the same time. Have 
 a look at the screen shot below.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrFrameWindow.jpg" alt="CAAAfrFrameWindow.jpg (100180 bytes)" width="638" height="583"></p>
 <p>It shows the application window that contains two document windows. It shows 
 also a palette of the tools available to work on the active document. This is a 
 Part document, and its window contains the 3D part, and the part's 
 specification tree as a 2D graph immersed into the 3D viewer displayed in the 
 document window. The active document being a Part document, the tools available 
 are those dedicated to parts. They are made of commands you can find in 
 pull-down menus and toolbars. The active command being dedicated to pad 
 definition, it displays a dialog box to enable the end user to enter its own 
 parameters to define or modify the pad being edited.</p>
 <p>Which are the objects that make all we have described above work, and how do 
 they relate to each other? Which interfaces should they implement? This is the 
 purpose of this article. These main objects are: </p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#200000">The application window</a></li>
   <li><a href="#The Document Window">The document window</a></li>
   <li><a href="#400000">The workshop, workbenches and add-ins</a></li>
   <li><a href="#500000">The interactive commands, their command headers</a></li>
   <li><a href="#How Commands Are Presented to the End User">The menu, the 
   toolbar ...</a></li>
   <li><a href="#Providing the Interactive Behavior">The document controller, in 
   other words the editor</a></li>
   <li><a href="#The objects providing the interactive behavior">The interactive 
   objects to manage the highlight, the temporary object visualization ...</a></li>
 </ul>
 <p>Most of these objects are detailed in the technical article entitled &quot;The 
 Frame Objects of the V5 Interactive Application&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>].&nbsp;</p>

 <h3><a name="200000"></a>The Application Window</h3>
 <p>It contains the document windows, which cannot escape from it. They can just 
 move inside its frame. In addition, the application window holds the menus and 
 toolbars, a message area, and possibly a power input keyboard.</p>
 <p>The application window is usually not customizable, and is simply retrieved 
 and used as is in applications, for example to set it as the parent window of 
 document windows or dialog boxes [<a href="#References">1</a>].</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h3><a name="The Document Window"></a>The Document Window</h3>
 <p>It is displayed inside the application window [<a href="#References">1</a>], 
 and shows a document. It provides a view, also called presentation, of the 
 document. Several windows can be displayed at the same time, some of them 
 possibly displaying the same document.</p>
 <p>The document window is the locus where the document can be edited. As a 
 result, if several windows display the same document, modifying the document in 
 one of these windows modifies the other windows, thanks to the MVC (Model View 
 Controller) paradigm implemented by CAA V5.</p>
 <p>Default document window classes are supplied: <i>CATGraphAnd2DWindow</i> for 
 2D documents, and <i>CATGraphAnd3DWindow</i> for 3D documents. They can display 
 a specification tree of the document in addition to the 2D or 3D view. A 
 customized document window can be created [<a href="#References">2</a>].</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h3><a name="Compound Documents - UI Active Object Definition"></a>Compound 
 Documents - UI Active Object Definition</h3>
 <p>As for any MDI application, the CAA V5 application window can contain 
 several windows to several documents, compared to a SDI application whose 
 application window can contain only one document window at a time. But rather 
 than supporting monolithic documents, CAA V5 supports also compound documents, 
 that is documents containing other documents. This means that documents can be 
 pointed (linked), or contained (embedded) by other documents of different 
 types, and can themselves point to or contain other documents. For example, a 
 Product document can contain several Part documents, placed in space at 
 appropriate locations and linked together to play their role in the part's 
 assembly.</p>
 <p>When you open an existing Product document, the Product document's menus and 
 toolbars making the workshop and the current workbench are made available, such 
 as the File and Analyze menus, and the Constraint toolbar.</p>
 <h3>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrWProduct.jpg" alt="CAAAfrWProduct.jpg (53264 bytes)" width="672" height="565"></h3>
 <p>When you double click on one of the parts making up the assembly, for 
 example here on P2 part, the selected part becomes the <b>UI-active</b> object. 
 The menus and toolbars change to those dedicated to Part documents, such as the 
 File and Insert menus, and the Sketch-based Features toolbar, and you can work 
 on this part using these tools.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrWSketch.jpg" alt="CAAAfrWSketch.jpg (89980 bytes)" width="672" height="565"></p>
 <p>You can remark that the active document is a Product displayed in a Product 
 window, but inside this window, the active object is a Part and since this 
 active object is a document, the Product workshop and workbench are replaced by 
 the Part workshop. The Part is called the UI-active object in the Product 
 document, UI standing for User Interface. Any document that can be included 
 into another document is a UI-activable object, but there is one UI-active 
 object at a time. By extension, we can say that the Part document activated in 
 a Part document window is itself the UI-active object. Moreover, some object 
 which are not documents can be UI-activable. This is for example the case for 
 sketches, which can neither be created using the New command, nor opened from 
 or saved to a file. Nevertheless, when you double click on a sketch, or when 
 you create a new sketch by dragging the Sketcher icon onto a reference plane, 
 the sketcher workshop is made active and replaces the Part workshop though the 
 sketch is not a document.</p>
 <p>When you double click on a sketch in this part, for example in the 
 specification tree, you change the 3D window into a 2D sketch window, and 
 change the Part document menus and toolbars to the sketch menus and toolbars. 
 The window remains the same, but the look and feel of it changes.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrWPart.jpg" alt="CAAAfrWPart.jpg (58363 bytes)" width="672" height="565"></p>
 <p>The Product and Part documents, as well as the sketch, load their own 
 editing tools when you request to edit them, rather than opening another 
 window. This is qualified as document-centric since the document remains 
 displayed in the same window, and the editing tools change around the document 
 to adapt to the type of the object being edited, even if this object is another 
 document. This is to be opposed to the application-centric model in which the 
 data to be edited is brought to another application for editing and is then 
 taken back in its genuine context. With the document-centric model, the 
 document remains displayed, and you edit a linked or contained document in the 
 context of the linking or containing document without opening another window. 
 For this reason, this is called edit-in-context. (OLE calls this in-place 
 activation, and OpenDoc calls it in-place editing.)</p>

 <h3><a name="400000"></a>Workshops and Workbenches</h3>
 <p>A CAA V5 document is associated with its own editing tools gathered in a <b>
 workshop</b>. Editing tools are commands that you arrange in menus and toolbars 
 that make up the workshop. Some menus and the standard toolbar are independent 
 from the type of the active document. They gather commands such as New, Open, 
 or Print. They belong to the application window and are automatically added to 
 any document's workshop. When a document is active, its own workshop is 
 available in addition to these menus and to the standard toolbar. Changing the 
 active document changes the active workshop if the new active document has a 
 type different from the previous active one. Otherwise, the same workshop 
 remains active, but possibly in a different configuration, in other words
 <a href="#410000">workbench</a>. <a href="#440000">Add-ins</a> allows you to 
 add commands to workshops or workbenches without rebuilding their shared 
 libraries and DLLs. To perform the appropriate
 <a href="#Transitions between Workbenches">transition</a> between these two 
 workbenches, the application should know what to do.&nbsp;</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h4><a name="410000"></a>Workbenches</h4>
 <p>You often want to group commands according to a given set of tasks they are 
 related to. A handy means is to create as many toolbars as sets of tasks you 
 define for your document, and let the end user select the toolbars to be 
 displayed and those to be hidden. For example, in a text processor, you could 
 group all the commands related to the text editing in a toolbar, those related 
 to drawing in a second, and those related to tables in a third. These toolbars 
 can be shown or hidden at end user will.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, in a complex application, the number of toolbars for a given 
 document may dramatically increase, and you may want to make available to the 
 end user only the toolbars dedicated to a given process at a time. To each 
 process corresponds a set of toolbars and menu items, and changing the current 
 process changes the available set of toolbars and menus while remaining in the 
 same workshop.</p>
 <p>For example, in a car repair workshop, you could imagine that the workshop 
 is organized for engine tuning, engine maintenance, and engine repair. The 
 workshop thus includes three workbenches, one equipped with tuning appliances, 
 the other with equipment dedicated to changing spark plugs, oil filters, 
 exhaust pipes, and engine sump draining, and the third with heavy equipment to 
 repair engines. The same can happen in a CAD application, with different 
 workbenches to work on a 3D model, such as a surface workbench, a solid feature 
 workbench, and an analysis workbench, each of these workbenches providing a 
 given usage configuration of the workshop dedicated to a specific process.</p>
 <p>One workbench only is available at a time, and it makes sense to have two 
 workbenches at least in a workshop. Otherwise, the workshop is also seen as a 
 workbench. The end user selects the workbenches using the Start menu. For 
 example, the Part document's workshop includes a Part Design workbench to 
 create shapes, and a Free Style workbench to create curves and surfaces, and to 
 modify and analyze shapes. This enables for a process-centric user interface.</p>

 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <h4><a name="440000"></a>Add-ins</h4>
 <p>The workshop and the workbenches show commands arranged in menus and 
 toolbars. Both can be extended by add-ins. An add-in is made of one or several 
 toolbars and menu items added to the workshop or workbench after it was 
 created. This allows for smooth extensions, without the need of rebuilding any 
 shared library or DLL, except the one for the add-in. Once created, the add-in 
 is part of the workshop or workbench to which it belongs. To enable for 
 add-ins, workshops and workbenches expose an interface including the workshop 
 or workbench identifier. For example, assume that a workbench identifier is 
 ShapeDesign. The interface this workbench exposes should be named 
 CATIShapeDesignAddin. Creating and add-in is described in the use case [<a href="#References">4</a>]</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

 <h4><a name="450000"></a>Overall Workshop Structure</h4>
 <p>The structure of the workshop associated with the (document) UI-active 
 object is described by the following picture.</p>
 <table>
   <tr>
     <td>
     <img src="images/CAAAfrWorkshopStructure.gif" alt="CAAAfrWorkshopStructure.gif (7475 bytes)" width="266" height="386"></td>
     <td><em>The workshop is made up of commands that are document independent, 
     such as New and Open in the File menu. These commands are group together in 
     an entity called General workshop. These commands are always available, 
     even if no document is active. The workshop also contains commands that are 
     document dependent. It can also include one or several add-ins. These 
     add-ins are part of the workshop, and are always available to the end user 
     when the workshop itself is available. A workshop can also include 
     workbenches. A workbench can in turn have its own add-ins. Like with 
     workshops, the add-ins are part of the workbench and are always available 
     to the end user when the workbench itself is available. Only one workbench 
     is available at a time. On the figure beside, Workbench2 is available, 
     along with its three add-ins. To have Workbench1 available, the end user 
     must select it in the Start menu. Then Workbench1 and its two add-ins 
     replace Workbench2 and its three add-ins.</em>
     <p><em>In fact, the end user sees only workbenches, and all the commands

 <h4 align="left"><a name="Transitions between Workbenches"></a>Transitions 
 between Workbenches</h4>
 <p>The Start menu offers to the end user a set of workbenches. Some of them are 
 provided by Dassault Systèmes as part of its products and solutions, others are 
 provided by third-parties, others can be home-made. From the end user 
 viewpoint, all these workbenches are on the same level, even if some are used 
 more than others. They can be selected by a simple click, even by error, and 
 what happens depends on which document and workbench were active at the moment 
 the end user clicks on another workbench. To perform the appropriate transition 
 between these two workbenches, the application should know what to do. You will 
 provide this knowledge using the <em>CATIWorkbenchTransition</em> interface you 
 will implement either on the workbench, or on the workshop.</p>
 <p>Transitions between workbenches can be classified in two main types, 
 depending on whether the active document can be connected to a document of the 
 type required by the selected workbench, or on the opposite has nothing to do 
 with such as document. In the latter case, no document can be retrieved, and a 
 new one should be created as if the end user had selected File-&gt;New. Otherwise, 
 if, for example, a Part document is the active document and if the end user 
 selects the Product Structure workbench, the end user intent may be to work at 
 the product level rather than at the part level, meaning that the part was 
 edited in-context. In this way, the product pointing to the part must be 
 retrieved upwards in the Part specification tree and made the active one, while 
 the Product Structure workbench is made available. The application should then 
 be able to retrieve from the active document and using the selected workbench 
 the document to make active, if it exists, whether this document contains or is 
 contained by the active document. These two main cases are detailed below and 
 can be classified into the following types of transitions. </p>
 <ol>
   <li>The active document type and the document type with which the selected 
   workbench is associated cannot be connected. This case can be divided into 
   the following transition sub-cases:
   <ol type="a">
     <li>Transition to a workbench associated with the type of the document 
     already active. The selected workbench belongs to the same workshop than 
     the active workbench. The end user intent is to select another set of 
     commands to work on the same document.
     <p>For example, assume that the end user selects the Free Style workbench 
     when a Part document and the Part Design workbench are active. Since the 
     Free Style and Part Design workbenches belong to the same workshop and are 
     both dedicated to Part documents, the active document remains active, and 
     only the Free Style workbench is activated for that document.</li>
     <li>Transition to the same workbench. A new document of the same type is 
     created. This is equivalent to using File-&gt;New.</li>
     <li>Transition to a workbench associated with a document type that can 
     neither point to nor be pointed by the active document type. A new 
     documentof the type associated with the selected workbench is created. The 
     end user intent is to create such a document, as with File-&gt;New.
     <p>For example, assume that the active document is a Part document and the 
     active workbench is Part Design. The end user selects the Material Library 
     workbench, which is for CATMaterial documents. Since a CATPart document 
     cannot contain, or be contained by, a CATMaterial document, a new empty 
     CATMaterial document is created in another window, and the selected 
     workbench is activated.</li>
   </ol>
   </li>
   <li>The active document type and the document type with which the selected 
   workbench is associated can be connected. This case can be divided into the 
   following transition sub-cases:
   <ol type="a">
     <li>Transition to a workbench corresponding to a document type that can be 
     pointed to by the active document.
     <p>For example, assume that the active document is a Product document and 
     the active workbench is Assembly Design. The end user selects the Part 
     Design workbench. It is associated to a Part document, usually pointed to 
     or contained by a Product document. Two sub-cases arise:
     <ul>
       <li>There is a selection in the active document. From this selection, the 
       application attempts to create or open a document of the required type. 
       In both cases, the application attempts first to create or open the 
       document in context, and if this fails, creates another window, and 
       activates the selected workbench. If the document to activate is already 
       opened in another window, it is activated in that window, thus not in 
       context.</li>
       <li>There is no selection in the active document. the application creates 
       a new empty document in another window, and activates the selected 
       workbench.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Transition to a workbench corresponding to a document type that can 
     point to the active document.
     <p>For example, assume that the active document is a Part document and the 
     active workbench is Part Design. The end user selects the Assembly Design 
     workbench. It is associated to a Product document, which usually points to 
     Part documents. The following sub-cases may arise:
     <ul>
       <li>The active document is edited in context. the application activates 
       the containing document and the selected workbench.</li>
       <li>The active document is not edited in context. If there is a pointing 
       document that the application is able to retrieve, this document is 
       activated if were already opened, or opened from its file. If there is no 
       pointing document, or if the application doesn't succeed to locate and 
       open it, a new empty document is created in another window, and the 
       selected workbench is activated.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
 </ol>
 <p>You should consider these cases when you create a new workbench, and figure 
 out the different cases that can happen depending on the type of the document 
 this workbench is associated with. As you can see, and even transitions happen 
 between workbenches, the associated document types always appear as a key 
 point, and, as a consequence, the workshop dedicated to the document type that 
 can often be used to implement once the same transitions involving all its 
 workbenches. This can simplify a bit your job if you are not the workshop 
 developer, since in this case you may have nothing to do.</p>
 <p>Transitions from and to your workbench should be designed knowing that the 
 application calls the workbenches and workshops involved in the transition in 
 the following order: </p>
 <ol>
   <li>The active workbench</li>
   <li>The active workshop</li>
   <li>The selected workbench</li>
   <li>The workshop to which the selected workbench belongs.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Any of them can decide what to do when a transition occurs. The application 
 calls them in that order until one of them decide. Its followers are then not 
 called. If none decides, the transition manager deducts that the selected 
 workbench belongs to the current workshop, and loads it.</p>
 <p>To simplify the workbench interrelationships, each workbench must specify 
 what should happen when it is selected, that is specify all its incoming 
 transitions, even when it already is the active workshop and is selected by the 
 end user. In addition, if your workbench is dedicated to a document type which 
 can be pointed or contained by the document type to which the active document 
 belongs, you should also implement the outgoing transitions to that workbench.&nbsp;</p>

 <h3><a name="500000"></a>Interactive Commands and Command Headers</h3>
 <p>Each command you want to make available in your workshop or workbench must 
 have a command header [<a href="#References">6</a>]. The command header plays 
 the role of your business card, which holds information such as your name, your 
 company, your function within the company, the address where your company is 
 located, your phone and fax numbers, and your e-mail id. This data is very 
 useful to contact you when you are not here, and occupy a very small space. It 
 stands for you in the pocket or the agenda of your friends, colleagues, and 
 customers or contractors. Like a business card, the command header holds the 
 necessary information to load the command, such as the command identifier, the 
 name of the shared library in which the command's executable code is located, 
 the name of the command class, and the data to pass to the command's code when 
 this command becomes the current one. The command header has resources for each 
 command to display, such as the command name shown to the end user, its tooltip 
 displayed in a balloon, its help message, and its icon. This enables the 
 workshop or workbench to be displayed, that is loaded in memory, without any of 
 its commands being itself loaded, except the default one, spares memory space, 
 and improves performance. The end user can see the icons in the toolbars, the 
 items in the menu bar, can ask for help on a given command, without the command 
 being loaded. It's only when he/she clicks on the menu item or on the icon that 
 the command code is actually loaded. In addition, the command header can manage 
 the command availability [<a href="#References">7</a>] with respect to what the 
 end user does, or what exists in the document .</p>
 <p><br>
 <strong>What happens at run-time?</strong> The first time a document of the 
 type you designed is created, opened or double-clicked, the application, by 
 means of the <i>CATApplicationFrame</i> class instance, asks for the document's 
 workshop using the <code>GetWorkshop(Name)</code> method of the <i>
 CATIUIActivate</i> interface implemented by the UI-activable object of your 
 document. <code>GetWorkshop</code> returns the workshop name, here Tools. Then 
 the application queries a pointer to the workshop factory interface, and 
 requests this factory to create an instance of the workshop class. This class 
 implements the <i>CATIWorkshop</i> interface which provides the methods <code>
 GetWorkshop</code> to create and return an instance of the workshop, <code>
 GetCommands</code> to instantiate the workshop's command headers, and <code>
 GetInterface</code> to return the interface derived from <i>
 CATIWorkshopConfiguration</i> and exposed by the workshop to allow for 
 workbenches. Once these methods have been called and the appropriate objects 
 created and returned to the <i>CATApplicationFrame</i> class instance, your 
 document is loaded and displayed in its window, and the workshop you've 
 designed for it is available. Then, for any created, opened or double-clicked 
 document of the same type, the same workshop object is used (<code>GetWorkshop</code> 
 is not called again). Nevertheless, a new set of command headers is created and 
 associated with the document to keep the workshop's status for the document. 
 The workshop status is the availability or unavailability of each command 
 depending on the document contents.</p>
 <p>To be emphasized or explained: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>A command must have a command header for each workshop in which is is 
   available</li>
   <li>A command header should be instantiated in the <code>CreateCommands</code> 
   method of the object that creates the starter and arranges the layout</li>
   <li>Scope of the command header identifier:

 <h3><a name="How Commands Are Presented to the End User"></a>How Commands Are 
 Presented to the End User</h3>
 <h4><a name="What Does the End User Sees?"></a>What Does the End User Sees?</h4>
 <p>Usually, commands are organized in the menu bar, as shown below:</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrAccess1.gif" alt="CAAAfrAccess1.gif (25709 bytes)" width="535" height="294"></p>
 <p>The menu bar contains menus, such as Tools, that contain themselves 
 commands, such as Analyze, and possibly submenus, such as Macro, that are 
 related to the menu topic. A submenu contains other commands and possibly 
 submenus that are related with the submenu topic. For example, the Macro 
 submenu contains the Macros, Start Recording, and Stop Recording commands. The 
 commands are shown as menu items.</p>
 <p>Commands are also contained in toolbars, like the Profiles toolbar shown 
 below undocked, that is, as a separate dialog box:</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrAccess2.gif" alt="CAAAfrAccess2.gif (10929 bytes)" width="472" height="344"></p>
 <p>The Profiles toolbar contains commands shown using icons, such as the 
 Profile command, and icon boxes, such as the icon box showing the Rectangle 
 Profile command. An icon box contains a series of commands, but only shows 
 either the first command in the icon box, or the last used. When the end user 
 clicks the arrow located at the icon box right corner, the icon box opens, and 
 the end user can select a command, such as the Parallelogram command. The icon 
 box is closed, the Parallelogram command is launched and replaces the Rectangle 
 command in the toolbar.</p>
 <p>Note that the a command that is presented in a toolbar should also be the 
 presented in the menu bar. This is a Windows 2000 recommendation to ensure that 
 a keyboard shortcut is available for any command.</p>
 <p>This is the end user view. Clicking on a menu item or an icon launches the 
 command that stands behind. Let's have a look at the objects you'll deal with 
 make this happen.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h4><a name="What Are the Command Exposition Underlying Objects?"></a>What Are 
 the Command Exposition Underlying Objects?</h4>
 <p>When you want to arrange commands to propose them appropriately to the end 
 user, you need to either create a workbench [<a href="#References">3</a>] or 
 create an add-in [<a href="#References">4</a>] to an existing workshop or 
 workbench. When you create such objects, you create in fact a containment tree 
 structure to access to the commands. All these objects are therefore called
 <strong>accesses</strong> and their base class is <i>CATCmdAccess</i>. The 
 objects that contain other objects are <strong>containers</strong>, and are 
 instances of the CATCmdContainer class. The first container is the workshop or 
 the workbench itself, and is an instance of the <i>CATCmdWorshop</i> or <i>
 CATCmdWorkbench</i> respectively, which both derive from <i>CATCmdContainer</i>. 
 This container usually contains a menu container, and one or several toolbar 
 containers. These containers can in turn contain other containers, such as a 
 submenu or an icon box. At the lowest levels of this tree structure, you put 
 the accesses for the commands. They are objects able to start the commands as 
 soon as the end user clicks on the menu item or on the icon, and are therefore 
 named <strong>command starters</strong>. Each command starter is associated 
 with a <strong>command header</strong> that stands for the command and that 
 holds the appropriate information about the command resources, such as the name 
 displayed in the menu or the icon displayed in the toolbar, whether the command 
 is available, and in which shared library the command code is located.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrAccess3.gif" alt="CAAAfrAccess3.gif (26129 bytes)" width="535" height="292"></p>
 <p>A container/contained tree structure is built. This tree structure 
 represents both the way objects are related to each other, and how they are 
 arranged in menus and toolbars in front of the end user. The figure above shows 
 these objects for the menu bar. The workshop or workbench container contains a 
 menu bar container that contains all the available menus, such as Tools. Tools 
 is a container that contains its submenu containers, such as Macro. It also 
 contains leaf objects for the commands, named command starters, such as the one 
 for the Analyze command, that stand for the command in the tree structure, and 
 that are associated with the command header. The submenu can also contain 
 separators to help for command layout. The Macro submenu container contains in 
 turn command starters, such as the one for Macros.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrAccess4.gif" alt="CAAAfrAccess4.gif (11306 bytes)" width="489" height="340"></p>
 <p>In the same way, the Profile toolbar is created as a container contained by 
 the workshop, and that contains command starters such as for Profile, and other 
 containers, such as Rectangle Profile which contains command starters to launch 
 commands to create pseudo rectangle profiles, such as Rectangle or 
 Parallelogram.</p>

 <p>The editor is described by the <i>CATFrmEditor</i> class [<a href="#References">1</a>]. 
 This class manages the <b>interactivity</b> of the document. An instance of 
 this class is created in the <i>CATIEditor</i> (ObjectModelerBase) interface 
 implemented by the document.&nbsp;</p>

 <h4><a name="The objects providing the interactive behavior"></a>The objects

 <ul>
   <li>The <b>CSO</b>, for Current Set of Objects: contains the current 
   object(s). The selected objects are placed in the CSO, and the CSO can be 
   used by any command to retrieve the selected objects. The Cut &amp; Paste, Copy &amp; 
   Paste, and Drag &amp; Drop use the CSO as input. The CSO is known by the current 
   command. Objects contained in the CSO have usually their graphical 
   representation highlighted.</li>
   <li>The <b>SDO</b>, for Set of Dialog Objects: contains objects to be placed 
   in toolbars such as input fields.</li>
   <li>The <b>ISO</b>, for Interactive Set of Objects: used to contain 
   interactive objects, that is objects that are not part of the document, but 
   which are displayed to enable their document object handling, such as 
   manipulator handles. A command can itself be put in the ISO, or an object it 
   aggregates. Such objects should implement the <i>CATI2DGeoVisu</i> or <i>
   CATI3DGeoVisu</i> interface. The classes <i>CATIExtGeo2DVisu</i> and <i>
   CATIExtGeo3DVisu</i> provide basic implementations of these interfaces 
   respectively</li>
   <li>The <b>CATSO</b>, for Set of Objects.</li>
   <li>The <b>CATXSO</b>, specialized by the following objects, known by the 
   viewer:
   <ul>
     <li>The <b>HSO</b>, for Highlighted Set of Objects: the objects that the 
     command highlights. Each object in the CSO is also in the HSO</li>
     <li>The <b>PSO</b>, for Prehighlighted Set of Objects: the objects that are 
     handled by a manipulator set by the current command, and that are 
     preactivated and moved.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>All these objects are created by the <i>CATFrmEditor</i> class instance 
 associated with the document.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <h4><a name="420000"></a>Context</h4>
 <p>A workshop is at a given time in a given context. What does this mean? Let's 
 take an example to illustrate this. Imagine the active document is a Part 
 document which includes a cylindric pad, as shown by the following figure.</p>
 <p>
 <img src="images/CAAAfrPartWindow.jpg" alt="CAAAfrPartWindow.jpg (64977 bytes)" width="688" height="523"></p>
 <p>At this moment, the Pad and Pocket icons are displayed grayed and cannot be 
 clicked. This is because no free sketch exists in the document that can be used 
 to create a pad or a pocket, and thus these commands are unusable. It's safe 
 then to make them unavailable. On the opposite, the Hole icon is colored, 
 meaning that the Hole command is available, since you can create a hole in the 
 pad by simply selecting a face and entering the hole definition parameters in 
 the dialog box displayed by the Hole command. Grayed and colored icons show 
 clearly which commands are not available and which commands can be used at a 
 given moment, depending on the document's context, that is often depending on 
 what it contains. This prevents from mistakes and end user errors the client 
 application should handle with additional code and error messages. When you 
 change the active document, the workshop retrieves the document's context and 
 displays as gray the icons of the unavailable commands in this context.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This behavior is managed by the <i>CATFrmEditor</i> class instance 
 associated with the document. This object contains the list of all the command 
 headers defined for a type of UI-active objects. Refer to the &quot;Life Cycle 
 Management&quot; section in the article [<a href="#References">6</a>].</p>

 <h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
 <p>The CAA V5 application window includes commands which are common to all 
 documents in menus and in the standard toolbar. Each document type is 
 associated with a workshop which includes commands arranged in menus and 
 toolbars which are added to the common menus and to the standard toolbar. 
 Changing the active document to another document changes the active workshop if 
 the new active document's type is different from the type of the previous 
 document. A workshop can include workbenches to gather commands dedicated to 
 specific tasks to structure the end user interface. One workbench only can be 
 active at a time.</p>

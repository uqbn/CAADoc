<h3><a name="Principles"></a>Incremental Warm Start Principles</h3>
<p>Until now, warm start meant simply automatically saving all documents every
xx minutes. Auto save operations on large amounts of data can take a long time,
even lasting several minutes, and all interactions since the last auto save are
lost. The auto save feature can also be deactivated by users who prefer to save
their documents frequently and manually to avoid losing data.</p>
<p>To resolve these problems the incremental warm start has been created. Its
objectives are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No CPU over cost perceptible for the end user,</li>
  <li>No loss of interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All open documents are copied in a temporary directory, and all modifications
since the document was opened are logged in a log file. These operations involve a minimum
inconvenience for the end user when opening documents (direct copy without
loading), and the logging of document modifications at each interaction is not
perceptible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the restore behavior:</p>
<ul>
  <li>after a crash, all documents are opened from the temporary directory
  <li>all modifications stored in the log are replayed
  <li>all necessary editors are opened
  <li>restoring data could take a long time:
    <ul>
      <li>all modifications made by users (including test/try, mistakes, etc.)
        are replayed
      <li>time is needed to replay necessary updates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the logged data correspond to operations done in commands. Some of
them are not always replayable. When it is the case, the warm start mechanism is
deactivated to avoid a bad restoration in case of crash.</p>
<p> A &quot;warm
start compliant&quot; workbench means that for any commands defined inside the workbench:</p>
<ul>
  <li>either the command is warm start compliant, it means that the command does
    not execute operations preventing a complete restoration,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>or the command deactivates the warm start.</li>
</ul>
<p> The incremental warm start mechanism is available for all Dassault
Systemes workbenches of the following
document types [<a href="#References">1</a>]:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part,
  <li>Product,
  <li>Drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This incremental warm start is activated through the Options
command.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<h3><a name="Technical Description"></a>Technical Description</h3>
<p>The aim of this section is first to give an internal description of the
data which allow us to support the incremental warm start, and then to explain how
this data is used during a session.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="data"></a>Backup Data</h4>
<p>Data to do an incremental backup is stored in the CNext02.roll directory
located in the <code>CATTemp</code> environment variable which is by default:</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Unix</td>
    <td valign="top">:</td>
    <td valign="top">$HOME/CATTemp</td>
  </tr>

    <td valign="top">:</td>
    <td valign="top">DriveName:\Documents and Settings\LogonName\Local Settings\Application
      Data\DassaultSystemes\CATTemp</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">CNext02.roll contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">
    <b>Documents</b>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">These are copies of all opened documents in session, no
    matter if those are visible or not. A copy is done either from the original
    file location ( in file environment) , or from a database (in ENOVIA
    environment).
    The name of each copy is an internal name, without relationship with the
    document original name.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A <b>Autosave.log</b> file</li>
  <p align="left">This file contains all modifications on the documents since
  they were copied to CNext02.roll. Moreover, it contains
  opening and closure orders on documents.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"> <a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a> shows how operations in this file
  are grouped in lots. Each lot is a &quot;transaction&quot; done on a
  document. The ith transaction can concern a document, and the i+1th another
  one.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">It should be noted that this file can reach a great size if the end user works a long time without saving documents.</p>
  <li>
    A <b>Undoredo.log&nbsp;</b>file</li>
  <p>The Autosave.log file stores operations without taking into account the
  undo or redo commands that the end user can do. Take the following example: the
  end user creates a point, and then cancels the operation. The creation is
  stored in the Autosave.log file, but not the reverse operation. It is the role
  of the Undoredo.log file to keep the &quot;track&quot; of transactions.</p>
  <p>The Undoredo.log file, smaller than the Autosave.log file,
  contains information on each transaction contained in the Autosave.log file.
  It also keeps track of the last closed (or validated) transaction. An opened transaction is a no validated
  transaction, and therefore not replayed at the restoration stage. It is
  detailed in the <a href="#Transaction validation">Transaction</a> section.</p>

<p align="left">Now that backup data is described, we can explained how it is used
according to end user interactions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>The session is opened in &quot;Incremental
    backup&quot;</b> <b>mode</b>- <a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a></li>
  <p>The CNext02.roll&nbsp;directory is created.</p>
  <li>
    <b>A first warm start compliant document is opened&nbsp;</b> (Part, Drawing ou Product)</li>
  <p >A copy of the document is done from its original location to the
  CNext02.roll directory.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b>Operations&nbsp;are done on the opened document</b></li>
  <p>The
Autosave.log and Undoredo.log files are modified.</p>
  <li><b>The document is saved</b></li>
  <p>As all opened documents are saved, the warm start can be re-initialized: the
Autosave.log and Undoredo.log files are emptied, and the copy of the document
  is redone.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b>Another warm start compliant document is opened&nbsp;</b></li>
  <p>Now, two documents are in the CNext02.roll&nbsp;directory. (If the
  Autosave.log and Undoredo.log files were present, they are not deleted.)</p>
  <li><b>One document is saved</b></li>
  <p>The
Autosave.log and Undoredo.log files cannot be deleted, since there is one dirty
  file left in memory. As long as there remains dirty documents in memory, a unique save
  is not sufficient to re-initialize (*) the warm start.</p>
  <p>(*) A re-initialization includes the destruction of the Autosave.log and
  Undoredo.log files and a copy from their original location of all loaded
  documents.</p>
  <li><b>Save All</b></li>
  <p>In this case, the re-initialization is possible. The Autosave.log and
  Undoredo.log files are deleted and the document copies are brought up to
  date.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b>Modification on documents are done, and then a
    command which is not warm start compliant is executed</b>  - <a href="#La liste des operations qui ne sont pas warm start compatibles&nbsp;">See
    the detailed list</a></li>
  <p>All data contained in the CNext02.roll directory are deleted. The end user
  is informed by the following message that the incremental warm start is
  deactivated:</p>
  <table border="0">
  <caption><a name="Fig.4">Fig.3 </a>Warm Start Deactivation Message From a Command.</caption>

    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAAfrWarmStartCommandKO.jpg" width="429" height="120"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>If the end user saves all the opened documents (Save All command) and
  leaves the no warm start compliant command, the warm
  start will be reactivated. As long as it is not done, the CNext02.roll
  directory stays empty.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Save All has been done, modifications are done, and <b>a document which is
    not warm start compliant is opened</b>  (A Process document for example)&nbsp;</li>
  <p>The incremental warm start is deactivated, and the CNext02.roll directory
  is emptied The end user is informed by the following message:</p>
  <table border="0">

    </tr>
  </table>
  <br><li><b>A warm start compliant workbench is activated</b></li>
  <p>Since the documents in memory are not saved, the following message appears:</p>

    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAAfrWarmStartWBOK.jpg" width="452" height="117"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Once all the documents are saved, the warm start is re-activated.</p>
  <p>However, if all documents are saved before the warm start compliant
  workbench activation, the following message appears:&nbsp;</p>
  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAAfrWarmStartWBOK1.jpg" width="330" height="120"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br><li><b>Closing a document</b> when the warm start is still active</li>
  <p>A copy of the document exists in the backup directory. There are two cases
  to consider:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If all other documents are saved, the warm start will be re-initialized,</li>
  <li>Otherwise, i.e. at least one document is still dirty, the copy of the
    closed document is not deleted, and the operations are recorded in
    the Autosave.log and Undoredo.log files.</li>
    
  </ul>
</ol>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Transaction validation"></a>Transaction</h4>
<p align="left">We have previously seen that the Autosave.log file contains the
operations recorded during the session, and that they are grouped together in
transactions <a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>. A transaction is a lot which
corresponds to a logical set of operations. When operations are replayed, only
full lots are redone. It also means that if the last lot is not &quot;closed&quot;,
it will be not replayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">To understand at which moment a transaction is closed, the type
of the executed command [<a href="#References">2</a>] must be
distinguished:&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Command Class Type</b></td>
    <td><b>Transaction Closure Time</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CATStateCommand &nbsp;</td>
    <td>When the command is ended</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CATDlgDialog&nbsp;or CATCommand&nbsp;</td>
    <td>When the next command will open a new transaction (*)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>(*) For CAA commands, it can be only a state command since the transactional
mechanism is not opened, and only the state commands open natively a transaction
when they are activated.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Here is the particular case of the Copy and Cut Command.&nbsp;</h5>
<ol>
  <li><h5>Clipboard not kept</h5>
    <p>Suppose that the end user launches the Cut or the Copy command, if the
    application crashes before or during the paste command, after the warm
    start, the Paste command will be not possible. The reason is that the Cut
    and Copy commands copy the selected object in the clipboard which cannot be
    restored by the warm start feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><h5>The Cut command is not executed if it is the last validated operation&nbsp;</h5>
  </li>
  <p>No data is lost.</p>
</ol>

<h3 align="left"><a name="CAA Workbench Integration"></a>CAA Workbench Integration</h3>
<p align="left">You are making a new workbench [<a href="#References">3</a>], you
should considerer its warm start integration. There are two cases to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is a workbench of a non warm start compliant document (
    Analysis, Process, ...)&nbsp;</li>
  <p align="left">You have nothing to do. By default, a workbench is not warm start compliant,
  so warm start will be not activated in this new workbench.&nbsp;</p>
    <li>
    <p align="left">It is a workbench of a warm start compliant document (Part,
    Product, Drawing)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">You should declare that the new CAA workbench is warm start
  compliant. It is done by adding the
following line in the CATRsc resource file of the workbench [<a href="#References">4</a>]:</p>

<table class="code">

    <td>

<h3 align="left"><a name="CAA Command Integration"></a>CAA Command Integration</h3>
<p align="left">Once you have created a command [<a href="#References">5</a>],
you should check its integration in the warm start mechanism. This section
explains you which commands are concerned, and if any, how you can use the <i>CATOmbWarmStartServices</i>
 class to activate, deactivate the warm start, or validate a transaction.
Commands which create applicative container, or use non V5 documents, end this
section.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><a name="What are Commands to Take Into Account?"></a>What are Commands to Take Into Account?</b></h4>
<p align="left">Any command which modifies a V5 document, launched from a
command header [<a href="#References">6</a>] or not, is concerned by the warm
start. However, these two following cases can be excluded:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Undefined command</li>
  <p>For recall, an undefined command is a command which is not seen by the
  focus manager [<a href="#References">2</a>]. It means that such command are
  never activated, deactivated or killed by this object. An example is the
  Search command [<a href="#References">7</a>]. These commands should not be
  concerned by the warm start, because they should not contain operations on
  document. Two commands should not work on the same object at the same
  time.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Command launched from a no warm start document</li>
  <p>Please note that if today the document does not support
  warm start, one day it could do it. If now, you can exclude the command, it is only
  because the warm start will be first deactivated by the workbench of the
  document.</p>

</ol>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Why and How Deactivate the Warm Start ?"></a>Why and How

<p align="left">It is necessary to make sure that the command will not corrupt
the backup restoration. For that it is necessary to analyze the operations which
are made on the document.&nbsp;</p>

    <li>Document creation by the <code>NewFrom</code> method of the <i>CATDocumentServices</i>
      class</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p align="left">To deactivate the warm start, you should use the <code>Deactivate</code>
 method of the <i>CATOmbWarmStartServices </i>class<i>.</i> This call must be
done in the command activation. Here is an code example:</p>

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>class CAAMyCommand : public CATCommand

}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left"><i>CAAMyCommand</i> derives from CATCommand, but it can be <i>CATStateCommand</i>
or <i>CATDlgDialog. </i>The unique common point is that the command is shared or
exclusive. The <code>Activate</code> method is called by the focus manager once
the command is activated or reactivated after a deactivation by a shared
command.&nbsp;In the two cases the deactivated
state is tested, because the command which has interrupted the <i>CAAMyCommand</i>
command might have reactivated the warm start.</p>

<h4 align="left"><a name="Why and How Activate or Re-initialize the Warm Start?"></a>Why and How
to Activate or Re-initialize the Warm Start?</h4>
<p align="left">If the command saves or closes one or several documents, it can
try to activate or re-initialize the warm start. The activation will succeed if
the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Warm Start option is activated, <a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1&nbsp;</a></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Command is launched from a workbench which authorizes the warm
    start,</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">All documents in session are saved, or not dirty. If you
    close or save all the loaded documents, this last condition is of course
    always true.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Activate</code>
 method of the <i>CATOmbWarmStartServices</i>  class enables you to try to
reactivate the warm start. This
call must be done just after the last closure or saving. Here is a piece of code:</p>

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>      CATUnicodeString WarningMessageToDisplay ;
      rc = <b>CATOmbWarmStartServices</b>::<b>Activate</b>(WarningMessageToDisplay);
      if (SUCCEEDED(rc) &amp;&amp; (0 != WarningMessageToDisplay.GetLengthInChar()) )
      {
         CATApplicationFrame *pFrame = CATApplicationFrame::<b>GetFrame</b>();
         if ( (NULL != pFrame ) &amp;&amp; ( NULL != pFrame-&gt;<b>GetMainWindow</b>() ))
         {
            CATDlgNotify * pNotify = new <b>CATDlgNotify</b>(
                                        pFrame-&gt;GetMainWindow(),
                                        &quot;AutoSaveId&quot;,
                                        CATDlgNfyInformation|CATDlgNfyOK|CATDlgWndModal) ;
                                        
            CATUnicodeString NotifyWindowTitle= &quot;....&quot;;
            pNotify-&gt;<b>DisplayBlocked</b>(WarningMessageToDisplay,NotifyWindowTitle);
            
            pNotify-&gt;<b>RequestDelayedDestruction();</b>
            pNotify = NULL ;
         }
      }
   }

<h4 align="left"><a name="Why and How Commit a Transaction?"></a>Why and How to Commit a Transaction?</h4>
<p align="left">Normally the operations inside a command are validated at the
end of the command for a state command, or at the activation of the next state
command for the
others type of commands. That means that as long as the validation is not made, if the V5
session is broken, the last operations will be not replayed at the backup.
However, you can force this validation during a command if it is necessary.</p>
<p align="left">The <code>CommitTransaction</code>  method of the <i>CATOmbWarmStartServices</i> 
class enables you to do so. This call must be done just after the last validated
operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Commands Creating Applicative Container"></a>Commands
Creating Applicative Container</h4>
<p align="left">The method to create an applicative container is the <i>CATCreateApplicativeContainer</i>
global function [<a href="#References">10</a>]. Once the applicative container is
created you have in this order to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Call its initialization through the <code>Init</code> method
    of the <i>CATInit</i> interface [<a href="#References">11</a>]</li>
  <p>You call it only if the container implements the <i>CATInit</i> interface.
  Inside this implementation you find the provider declarations, and sometime feature creations.</p>
  <li>Call the <i>CATOmbPerformAfterContainerCreation</i> global
    function</li>
  <p>This call enables the application to initialize the undo/redo and the
  transactional mechanism on the container. This call must always be called <b>after</b>
  the container initialization. If you do it before the operations done
  in the <code>Init</code>  method will be stored in the backup data. So when
  the document will be reloaded, the operations in the <code>Init</code>  method
  will be executed twice: first by the warm start restoration and a second time,
  by the automatically call to the <code>Init</code>  method.&nbsp;</p>
</ol>
Here is an extract of code to create an applicative container inside a command:

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>The incremental backup is a mean to distribute the &quot;automatic save&quot; time along the
session. The principle is to keep a copy of the loaded documents and to store
the modifications done on these documents. In case of crash, it is possible to
restore the model such as it was before the interruption of the session,
except the last non validated transaction.</p>
<p>However, some operations on data are not re-playable. If the warm
start is not stopped before executing them, the restoration will be corrupted.
This article explains why and how the warm start should be deactivated for a
single command or for the whole workbench.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>The mouse is the main device used to interact with CATIA. The end user
      should be able to perform many kinds of actions with only three buttons
      and mouse moves. The mouse quickly delegates the end user intended actions
      to manipulators set onto the representations of the model objects. Here we
      present the notification protocol used to standardize the end user
      intents.

<h3><a name="100000"></a>What Happens when the End User Plays with the Mouse</h3>
<p>When the end user moves the mouse above, drags, clicks or double-clicks on an
object, this is to do something on this object. Manipulators allows for mapping
behaviors on objects, as if they could propose themselves the available tools to
manipulate objects. In addition, manipulators provide consistent user interface
guidelines through the reactivity of the model objects when the mouse is located
or moves on the representations which stand for them.</p>
<p>A representation is then controlled by the manipulator. It's the way to
define what happens when:
<ul>
  <li>The mouse is located or moves above a representation controlled by a
    manipulator: the representation is preactivated, ready to be manipulated. It
    can be highlighted, and handles can appear to allow for manipulating it</li>
  <li>The left button of the mouse is pressed on this representation: the
    representation is activated</li>
  <li>The mouse drags the representation with the left button pressed to move it
    or drags a handle of the representation to deform it: the representation is
    being manipulated</li>
  <li>The left button of the mouse is double clicked on a representation: the
    represented model object is asked to edit itself by providing an editing
    dialog window</li>
  <li>The right button of the mouse is pressed on this representation: the model
    object is asked to show the contextual actions that can be performed against
    it. A contextual menu is displayed</li>
  <li>The mouse is located or moves on a representation while the the help key
    or the F1 key is pressed: help is asked on the represented model object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The different end user actions introduced above set the manipulator in
different states that we can define using a finite state machine.</p>
<p>The state of a manipulator is composite and made of three parts:
<ol>
  <li>The <i>interactive</i> part describes the action of the end user on the
    manipulator at a given time. It is encoded using the MState member data of
    the class CATManipulator</li>
  <li>The device part describes if a manipulator is current for dragging, that
    is can be used from now on by non-pointing devices (devices which cannot
    choose objects on the screen such as key arrow or space ball). It is encoded
    using the MDeviceState member data of the CATManipulator class</li>
  <li>The <i>edit</i> part describes if the popup containing the dialog for
    editing parameters to move or deform the object is there or not. It is
    encoded using the MEditState member data of the CATManipulator class.</li>
</ol>
<p>This figure shows the states of a manipulator (in boxes) and the
notifications sent when shifting from one state to another (along the arrows)
due to end-user interactions represented by the mouse, here with the first
manipulator style used (left button pressed):</p>

<p>The viewer reacts to the user interactions by publishing update
notifications. The object, father of the manipulator in the command tree
structure, needs to subscribe to these notifications by means of the callback on
send/receive mechanism through the <tt>AddAnalyseNotificationCB</tt> method.
This object, which is often the current interactive command, triggers then the
appropriate method to assign an edit window if MEditState is set to Running, or
a contextual menu if MState is set to InContext, or let the manipulator do its
job if MState is set to Manipulate.</p>
<p>The manipulator states are fully described below.
<dl>
  <dt><b>MState InNormal</b></dt>
  <dd>The mouse is not yet located above the representation controlled by the
    manipulator</dd>
  <dt><b>MState InPreactivate</b></dt>
  <dd>The mouse moves and at a given time intersects a representation controlled
    by the manipulator without pressing any button. At this moment, the
    manipulator receives a Preactivate notification, sets MState to
    InPreactivate and defines the preactivation of the representation. To do
    this, the manipulator sends a Preactivate notification to its father in the
    command tree structure, that is to the instance of the CATCommand class or
    one of its derived class used as one of the manipulator constructor
    arguments. This notification is an instance of the CATPreactivate class.<br>
    For example, a manipulator used for selection will usually highlight the
    representation.<br>
    When the mouse moves on a representation with a preactivated manipulator,
    that is a manipulator with MState set to InPreactivate, the viewer publishes
    a Move notification as long as the mouse moves and remains located above the
    representation.<br>
    When the mouse leaves the representation, the manipulator receives an
    EndPreactivate notification. By default, it sends an EndPreactivate
    notification to its father and sets MState to InNormal.</dd>
  <dt><b>MState InActivate</b></dt>
  <dd>A manipulator has MState set to InPreactivate. The end user clicks on the
    mouse left button. The manipulator receives an Activate notification and
    sets MState to InActivate. By default, a notification, instance of the
    CATActivate class, is sent to its father. This notification must be
    interpreted as &quot;I have taken this element&quot;. The manipulator
    MDeviceState is set to Plugged. If a different manipulator was already
    plugged, its MDeviceState turns to Unplugged. When a manipulator is plugged,
    it can receive the notifications of the devices used to manipulate, such as
    the space ball, the keyboard, the mouse, and so forth.</dd>
  <dt><b>MState InManipulate</b></dt>
  <dd>A manipulator has MDeviceState set to Plugged. It has subscribed to the
    BeginManipulate notification. The left button of the mouse is pressed on the
    representation. If the manipulator MState was not set to InActivate before
    the mouse left button is pressed, it is first set to InActivate before then
    be set to InManipulate until the end user releases the mouse.<br>
    The viewer sends a BeginManipulate notification which includes the x and y
    pixel coordinates of the mouse location. The manipulator receives it through
    the publish/subscribe mechanism and sends a notification, instance of the
    CATBeginManipulate class, to its father. In most cases, a mathematical
    transformation along with a matrix and a vector are initialized to identity
    and sent as part of the notification.<br>
    When the object is dragged, that is, for example, when the mouse moves with
    the left button down, or when the space ball is pressed, or when the arrow
    down key is pressed, the viewer publishes a Manipulate notification.
    Depending on the device used to manipulate, the manipulator updates the
    mathematical transformation between the previous position of the graphical
    object and the current value resulting from the manipulation. A
    notification, instance of the class CATGenerateEvent, is sent by the
    manipulator. The command attached to the manipulator receives this
    transformation, possibly modifies it to satisfy the applicative constraints,
    and deforms or moves the appropriate model objects accordingly.<br>
    When the mouse left button is released, a CATEndManipulate notification is
    sent and the manipulator MState returns to InNormal. If the mouse remains on
    the representation, a Preactivate notification is sent and the MState is set
    to InPreactivate.</dd>
  <dt><b>MState InContext</b></dt>
  <dd>A manipulator has MState set to InPreactivate. The end user presses the
    mouse right button. A Context notification is sent to the manipulator which
    MState is set to InContext. This one creates a contextual menu and sends a
    notification, instance of the CATContext class, to its father. The father
    command can then put items in this contextual menu and connect to these
    items by means of the publish/subscribe mechanism and the <tt>AddAnalyseNotificationCB</tt>
    method. When an item is chosen, the command which is attached to this item
    is called back and executes its applicative task. When the callback ends,
    the manipulator receives the EndContext notification and kills the
    contextual menu. MState returns to InNormal.<br>
    The contextual menu is specific to each manipulator and is redefined each
    time a contextual action is asked on a manipulator.</dd>
  <dt><b>MStateEdit Running</b></dt>
  <dd>A manipulator is preactivated or activated and the associated
    representation is double clicked. If the manipulator was only preactivated,
    it first becomes activated. An Edit notification is published by the viewer.
    The default behavior of the manipulator consists in sending a notification,
    instance of the CATEdit class to its father. The command connected to the
    manipulator can decide to value the MEditState of the manipulator to Running
    to associate dialog with it. The command must create a popup and assign it
    to the manipulator. This popup is supposed to contain dialog components,
    such as alphanumeric fields, slider, other specific representations with new
    manipulators, and so forth, for changing the values exported by the
    manipulator. The destruction of these elements occurs when the command
    receives the CATEndEdit notification, that is when the manipulator leaves
    the edit state. The manipulator MEditState returns to NotRunning when the
    edit popup is destroyed when the end-user presses ok, cancel or close). In
    most cases, the command will not define the contents of the edit popup. A
    specific manipulator, such as a translation or a rotation manipulator, will
    have its own edition window to define the value of the event exported by the
    manipulator.<br>
    A non trivial use of the edit state can be to have a manipulator for
    selection connected to a set of objects. Its behavior when MEditState is
    turned to Running can consist in displaying the controlled representations
    in the edit window and assigning them specific manipulators to deform the
    model object geometry. Leaving the edit window turns MEditState to
    NotRunning and destroys the manipulators used for the deformation.</dd>

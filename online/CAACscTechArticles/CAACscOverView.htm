      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>C++ Source Checker contributes to enhance the global quality objectives
      of CAA V5 application. Operating at the source stage in the application
      development cycle, early checking against C++ coding rules will ensure
      better stability and reduce defect. As for other RADE products, it
      operates on both NT and UNIX platform with the same characteristics.

<h3><a name="Why use"></a>Why should you use CSC ?</h3>
<h4><a name="What"></a>What is a static controller</h4>
<p>CSC (C++ Source Checker) is a C++ static controller.</p>
<p>A static controller is an application which analyzes a program and tries to
discover potential defects or logical errors without executing the program.
Opposite to a dynamic control occurring while running the program (like mkodt for example
), CSC works on C++ source code. The analysis part is similar to the
front part of a compiler, therefore CSC includes its own C++ parser.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Positionning"></a>Positioning CSC in the development process</h4>
<p><a name="Development Process"></a><b>The development process</b></p>
<p>A part of the development process of an application can be summarized by the
following chart:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/CAACscTechArticles_Overview_DevProcess.gif" width="172" height="230"></p>
<p>A static controller should be used after compiling the program. It is
interesting to notice that compilers themselves contain static controls (type
checking, for example).</p>
<p><a name="Benefits"></a><b>Benefits of using CSC</b></p>
<p>After compiling the program, running CSC can detect corrupting errors before
dynamic tests. This insures a better way of programming, reducing development
and debug time.</p>
<p>Most of the hits detected by CSC can not be detected by any other tool,
except by a manual code review. CSC does quickly and automatically this job.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Checked rules"></a>Checked Rules</h3>
<p><a name="AddRef"></a><b>AddRef / Release rules</b></p>
<p>A set of rules are provided that help debugging easily and quickly Object
Modeler (directly or indirectly implied by QueryInterface) memory leaks within
tested code. Debugging memory leaks can be very time consuming, as CAA and COM
architecture is very complex. This automatic detection addresses a major need
for large application projects where pieces of code are re-used by different
developers. As they don't always know when the memory reservation has been done,
they may not (or forget to) Release it, which leads to potential memory crashes
during the execution of the application.[<a href="#References">1</a>]</p>
<p><a name="LifeCycle"></a><b>Pointer LifeCycle rules</b></p>
<p>Another aspect when checking sources is the ability to analyze discrepancies
usage of C++ null pointers. Checking these rules ensures a better control on the
number of core dump occurring during the execution of the application.[<a href="#References">2</a>]
[<a href="#References">3</a>]</p>
<p><a name="ForbiddenConstructions"></a><b>Forbidden constructions rules</b></p>
<p>Some constructions, due to migrations, are deprecated, and others, due to
specific Object Modeler rules, are forbidden. These rules consist in lists of
prohibited identifiers, calls of methods, uses of classes or interfaces ...[<a href="#References">4</a>]</p>
<p><a name="Callbacks"></a><b>Callbacks rules</b></p>
<p>Using Callbacks in CAA implies using function pointers with a cast. These
casts may be dangerous cause the compiler does not check if the function pointer
meets the specification required by the soft. CSC checks the signature of the
function passed to the callback method in order to prevent runtime crashes.[<a href="#References">5</a>]</p>
<p><a name="Exceptions"></a><b>Exceptions rules</b></p>
<p>Some methods provided by CAA can, depending on the context, throw an
exception. CSC reports the usage of these methods if the exception is not
handled by the user code, thus preventing a potential application crash at
runtime. This check is close to the &quot;exception not caught&quot; compilation
error generated by any java compiler.[<a href="#References">6</a>]</p>
<p><a name="C++"></a><b>C++ rules</b></p>
<p>Some basic C++ programming rules are checked by CSC, like a correct usage of
allocation/de-allocation routines.[<a href="#References">7</a>]</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture in brief</h3>
<p>CSC provides its own C++ source parser. It ensures that sources are well
checked against the provided rules. The parser acts as a front task compiler, it
generates the syntax tree of the source, creates the symbol table [<a href="#References">8</a>].
Multiple sources and frameworks checking can be handled across different
workspaces, thus taking into account potential external prerequisite frameworks.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="How To Use"></a>How to use</h3>
<p>CSC works only on CAA File Trees (CAA source files are managed and delivered
in components whose structure respects a particular organization). Though
compilation step is not required, it is strongly recommended. Indeed, CSC works
as a front task compiler, but without reporting compilation errors. The C++
parser will not run accurately if the source contains build errors ; no error or
message indicating that the source has not been correctly analyzed will be
reported.</p>
<p>C++ Source Checker provides a command line access. An integration is also
available in C++ interactive dashboard. Command line usage is of the form:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>mkCheckSource -f framework_to_analyze -html output_directory</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Parse of C++ code can operate from the workspace to be analyzed and a
provided pattern matching list of frameworks inside this workspace. Developers
can also start the parse providing only a pattern matching list of sources to be
analyzed [<a href="#References">9</a>].</p>
<p>Only predefined rules are coded in the tool. These rules are either native
C++ coding rules, or CAA coding rules. No open API is available for user coding
rules.</p>
<p>CSC tool works with XML setting files. Default setting files are provided.
Users can define their own setting files and append these setting files to
delivered ones or replace delivered setting files by their own setting files [<a href="#References">10</a>].</p>
<p>CSC provides a full HTML report with hyperlink to defaulter C++ source, ready
to be exploited. It includes full features hyperlink that allow a deep analysis
from framework to responsible C++ source line. Detected errors are highlighted
at all level from framework to module to C++ source line and word. This ensures
an easy and reliable analysis of the checked code that permits a fast
correction.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>Different C++ rules are checked against the source code. Thanks to these
checks, time spent to debug applications is drastically reduced, and quality of
the code is improved. Developers are provided with a number of rules that help
them reduce memory inherent bugs in domain such as application memory
management, call back mechanism usage, exception handling and C++ programming
rules. These sensitive checks ensure a better control of application quality and
globally decrease the number of bugs related to memory corruption. Another
aspect when checking sources is the ability to analyze discrepancies uses of C++
null pointers. This check ensures a better control on the number of core dump
occurring during the execution of the application. The last aspect would be the
detection of migration problems.</p>

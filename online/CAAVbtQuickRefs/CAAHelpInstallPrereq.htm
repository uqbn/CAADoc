<title>Help: Install Prereq</title>
</head>

<body>

<p><u><strong>With this popup you can specify the way you want to access to prerequisites</strong></u></p>

<p>There are 3 modes to access prerequisites.  In all cases, you must indicate the <strong>root directory(ies) of
workspace(s)</strong> where they can be found. 
<ul>
<li>copy prerequisites locally in your workspace</li>
<li>set a reference to others workspaces</li>
<li>copy prerequisites in a local directory, different from your workspace
directory. 
You must also specify the directory where prereqs have to be copied.
<br><em><u>Note</u>:</em> This mode executes a mkCopyPreq to copy Prereq frameworks
needed for buildtime, to the given local directory, Then the mkGetPreq command is launched
in order to prepare the runtime environment. So after wizard execution, buildtime and
runtime environments are ready for use.</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>With this popup you can migrate a workspace.</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have developed in a workspace on a CAA Release N level, and wish to
migrate your code to a new CAA Release N+x level, you must migrate your
workspace. The first thing to do is to create a new workspace, as described
above. Select a new location for the new workspace, as well as the tool level
corresponding to the CAA Version level you are targeting. After this is done,
appears a choice of possible options. Select &quot;<code><font color="#008040">Migrate
a workspace</font></code>&quot; and press &quot;<code><font color="#008040">Finish</font></code>&quot;.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="6" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/CAAVbtMsDevMigrate.gif" width="601" height="244"></td>
    <td>In <b>Target Level</b>, select the CAA release to which you want to
      migrate your workspace.
      <p>In <b>Origin Workspace</b>, enter or select the pathname of the
      workspace to migrate. If a UNIX connection is enabled and if the CAA
      release you select in <b>Target Level</b> is less than V5R11, you must
      also enter the pathname of the workspace's replica on UNIX in <b>Origin
      Workspace UNIX</b>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The new workspace will then be populated with the code from the origin
workspace. You need to set your prerequisites to point to the new CAA code and
build your code.</p>

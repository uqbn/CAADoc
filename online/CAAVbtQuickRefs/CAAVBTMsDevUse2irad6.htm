     <h3>Abstract</h3>
     <p>This article describes the use of Source Code Manager (SCM) commands 
     that can be found in IBM Rational Software 
     Development Platform (IRAD), other commands (especially mkmk 
     and related functionalities) are detailed in another 
     article:
     <a href="CAAVBTMsDevUseirad6.htm">Principles of use - How to 
     Open and Build 
     a CAAV5 Workspace</a>.</p>
     <p>If you are working with the <em>C++ Interactive Dashboard</em> and your
     <em>Developer Studio</em> environment has not been set-up for CAAV5 tools, 
     we advise you to read Customizing IRAD 
     in which you will find information to help you to set 
     it up and to migrate a 
     CAAV5 File Tree in a format which is usable by
     IRAD.</p>
     <p>Finally, if you are familiar with the use of CAAV5 commands, the
     Workbench Commands Mapping 
     article will 
     give you the correspondences between DOS/shell commands and <em>Developer 
     Studio</em> or <em>Java Dashboard</em> menus and dialog boxes.</p>
     <p>Note that in the rest of this paper, labels of menus or window items are 
     written using <code><font color="#008040">this format</font></code>.</p>

   </tr>
 </table>
 <p>There are three situations to study:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>It's the first time you work with the Workspace Manager: consult the
   <a href="CAAVBTJavaDashboardirad6.htm">Customizing
   IBM Rational Software Development Platform</a> 
   article to learn about how to declare a workspace to the Workspace Manager.</li>
   <li>You've just created/declared a workspace to the Workspace Manager: in 
   this case this workspace is the current working workspace and Workspace 
   Manager commands are available.</li>
   <li>You've created a workspace but you have stopped and run again
   IRAD: in this case you have no 
   current workspace and you must open one, this is explained below.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4><a name="How_to_open_a_workspace"></a>Opening a Workspace</h4>
 <ol>
   <li>In the <code><font color="#008040">Navigator</font></code> view, 
   right-click a project and select the <font color="#008040"> <code>Open
   CAAV5 Workspace</font></code> command. The Open CAA V5 Workspace dialog box 
   displays.</li>
   <li>In the <code><font color="#008040">With:</font></code> combo box, 
   select <font color="#008040"><code>Mkmk &amp; Source Code Manager</font></code>
   to enable the last three fields. You 
   will also access mkmk commands (instead of the <code><font color="#008040">
   Mkmk</font></code> choice which does not give access to Source Code Manager 
   commands).</li>
 </ol>
 <p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="images/MsDev34irad6.gif"></p>
 <ol start="3">
   <li>Enter the name of the workspace in the Workspace Name field.</li>
   <li>In the Tool level combo box, select a tool level and click <code>
   <font color="#008040">OK</font></code>. A log window appears while your 
   environment is updated and the workspace opened. When this window has 
   disappeared, IRAD loads the project 
   files it stored in your workspace and you are ready to work.</li>
 </ol>
 <h3><a name="How_to_work"></a>Working with SCM</h3>
 <p>Source Code Manager commands are useful for workgroup support, that is when 
 several people work on the same software and need to share their files. Using 
 the Source Code Manager each person create its workspace, all workspaces 
 declared in a base are organized in a tree whose top is called BSF, 
 intermediate levels are typed project and leaves are <strong>developmen</strong>t 
 workspaces: the commands available from the dashboard are those needed in this 
 kind of workspace, if you need other commands you can open a DOS window in 
 which you can run any of them from the workspace currently opened in
 IRAD.</p>
 <ul>
   <li>From the <code><font color="#008040">Window</font></code> 
   menu, select the <code><font color="#008040">Open command window</font></code>
   command.</li>
 </ul>
 <p align="center"><img src="images/MsDev35irad6.gif" width="452" height="161"></p>
 <h4><a name="Locally_in_your_workspace"></a>Working Locally in Your Workspace</h4>
 <p>When working with the Workspace Manager any action performed on the content 
 of the workspace file system must be declared - registered in a repository - to 
 the Workspace Manager:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#Declare_new_CNext_directories">New CNext directories</a> 
   (frameworks, modules), <a href="#Declare_new_files">new files</a>.</li>
   <li><a href="#Deletion_of_directories_or_files">Deletion</a> of directories 
   or files.</li>
   <li><a href="#Move_of_directories_or_files">Move</a> of directories or files.</li>
   <li><a href="#Modification_of_existing_files">Modification</a> of existing 
   files.</li>
 </ul>
 <h5><a name="Declare_new_CNext_directories"></a>Declaring new CNext directories</h5>
 <p>New CNext directories must be declared only if they have been created in 
 your workspace, not if they have been copied from another workspace (because 
 they might have already been declared from this other workspace).</p>
 <ol>
   <li>From the <code><font color="#008040">Source Code Management</font></code> menu, select the
   <code><font color="#008040">Declare Directory in Database...</font></code> 
   command.</li>
   <li>Use the file tree displayed and select the directories to register using 
   the corresponding check buttons.</li>
 </ol>
 <p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="images/MsDev11irad6.gif" width="541" height="403"></p>
 <p>Note that:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>If you declare a new Module (see figure above) in a new Framework, do
   not 
   forget to declare the embedding framework too.</li>
   <li>A directory can be registered by only one person, other people can only 
   get a copy of it by selecting the <code><font color="#008040">Attach 
   Frameworks\Modules</font></code> command from the 
   <font color="#008040"><code>Source Code Management</font></code> menu.</li>
 </ul>
 <h5><a name="Declare_new_files"></a>Declaring new files</h5>
 <p>Like for directories, files created in your workspace must be registered in 
 the Workspace Manager repository. To do so, select the <code>
 <font color="#008040">Declare File in Database...</font></code> command from 
 the <font color="#008040"><code>Source Code Management</font></code> menu.</p>
 <p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="images/MsDev12irad6.gif" width="531" height="676"></p>
 <p>When you click <code><font color="#008040">OK</font></code>,
 a log window is 
 displayed while the files are being registered. After the completion, the 
 selected files are no more writable except if you checked the
 <font color="#008040"> <code>Check-Out</font></code> check box, in this case each file 
 is <a href="#Modification_of_existing_files">checked out</a> after its 
 registration, so you can continue to work on it.</p>

     <img src="images/MsDevCaution.gif" width="32" height="32"></td>
     <td width="96%" valign="top">Any (source) file needed to build a component 
     must be declared to the Workspace Manager because the tool doesn't browse

     want to know if all has been registered you can ask the Workspace Manager 
     to <a href="#Check_your_workspace_against_database">check your file system</a>.</td>

 <h5><a name="Deletion_of_directories_or_files"></a>Deleting Files</h5>
 <p>Any file or directory can be removed from any workspace, however, 
 considering the deletion of components is not a task devoted to developers, no 
 command to remove a directory has been provided through
 IRAD.</p>

       instead. </li>
       <li>You must use Workspace Manager commands to remove data from your

     <p>Select the file or directory to move, and drag &amp; drop it to the 
     destination directory, or use the Cut and Paste contextual menu items.</p>
     <h6><b>To Rename a file or a directory</b></h6>
     <p>Select the file or the directory to rename, and click once more to

 <h5><a name="Modification_of_existing_files"></a>Modifying existing files</h5>
 <p>Before modifying a file, check it out from the Workspace Manager repository, 
 the main interest being to indicate that this file is being modified and that 
 any further command should take care of it:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>If you promote your workspace, any checked-out file will be promoted too.</li>
   <li>If you synchronize your workspace and if some files have been modified by 
   anyone else, you will be prompted to merge your own copies with the ones 
   coming from your father workspace.</li>
   <li>You will not be able to detach any framework or module if they contain at 
   least one checked-out file.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>To check-out a file, select <code><font color="#008040">Check-Out</font></code> 
 from the <font color="#008040"><code>Source Code Management</font></code> menu. 
 The current edited file is selected by default. As you may want to check-out 
 several files at the same time you can select several files in the file tree.</p>
 <p align="center">
 <img border="0" src="images/MsDev38.gif" width="547" height="643"></p>
 <table width="100%">
   <tr>
     <td width="4%" valign="top">

     <td width="96%" valign="top"><a name="private_file"></a>It is possible to 
     check-out a file in a special mode named <em>private</em>. In this case, 
     the file can be modified but the system will prevent you from delivering 
     this file. For instance, when you want to modify some files for debug 
     purpose, you do not want these modifications to be promoted with other 
     normal modifications. To do so, from the <code><font color="#008040">Source 
     Code Management</font></code> menu, select the 
     <font color="#008040"><code>Private Files-&gt;Check-Out Private File</font></code>
     command. The file which is currently edited will be 
     checked-out in <em>private</em> mode.</td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <h5><a name="Check_your_workspace_against_database"></a>Check Your Workspace 
 Against Database</h5>
 <p>The purpose of checking your workspace against the (Workspace Manager) 
 database is to detect files which are not yet managed or which have been edited 
 without checking them out. This command helps you prepare your workspace to be 
 delivered to other people because only modifications declared to the Workspace 
 Manager will be delivered afterwards.</p>
 <ul>
   <li>From the <font color="#008040"><code>Source Code Management</font></code> 
   menu, select the <code><font color="#008040">Information-&gt;Check Workspace</font></code> command. A 
   dialog box is opened in which you can select the framework to check, which 
   can be useful for a workspace containing many frameworks.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Check messages are displayed in the <code><font color="#008040">Mkmk</font></code> 
 output window that lets you run omitted commands without losing these traces. 
 The detected errors can be:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>A file existing in the file system and not in the CAAV5 Workbench 
   database.</li>
   <li>A file existing in the CAAV5 Workbench database and not in the file 
   system.</li>
   <li>A checked-out file in READ only mode.</li>
   <li>A file which is not checked out in write mode.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>To fix these errors, you can:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Declare missing files in the database using <code><font color="#008040">
   Declare File in Database..</font></code>..</li>
   <li>Extract the file from the database by projecting the embedding directory, 
   consult the
   <a href="../CAAWsmQuickRefs/CAAWsmProject.htm">
   adl_project</a> reference page.</li>
   <li>Change the file mode using Windows commands. You might have modified 
   this file without checked-out it, check it now:</li>
 </ol>
 <blockquote>
   <ul>
     <li>Make a copy of your file</li>
     <li>Check-out the file using <code><font color="#008040">Check-Out</font></code>: 
     this will produce an error asking you to move a file - given by the 
     Workspace Manager - to overwrite the file you modified. Overwrite it.</li>
     <li>Check-out again the file, this won't produce the previous error 
     message.</li>
     <li>Overwrite the checked-out file with your copy.</li>
   </ul>
 </blockquote>
 <h4><a name="With_other_people"></a>Working With Other People</h4>
 <p>When working in a development workspace, only 2 commands are necessary to 
 exchange data with other people. A development workspace has a father workspace 
 and no son, so the only data flow is to or from the father workspace:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>To transfer modifications from the current workspace to the father 
   workspace, select <code><font color="#008040">Promote..</font></code> from 
   the <code><font color="#008040">Source Code Managemen</font></code>t menu.
   </li>
   <li>To see what will be promoted if you select <font color="#008040">
   <code>Promote...</font></code>, you can run a simulation by selecting <code>
   <font color="#008040">Simulate the promotion</font></code>.</li>
   <li>To get modifications from your parent workspace and integrate them into 
   your workspace, from the <font color="#008040"><code>Source Code Management</font></code>

 <h4><a name="With_multiplatforms_workspaces"></a>Working With Multiplatform 
 Workspaces</h4>
 <p>A multiplaform workspace is a workspace having one database representation 
 and two file system representations: one on a Windows machine and another one 
 on a Unix machine. The process to create such a workspace is broken down into 
 three steps:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Create the workspace. This can be done on Unix or Windows, the workspace 
   is associated with a file system which is specified at creation.</li>
   <li>If you want to access this workspace from the other operating system, 
   associate another file system with the same workspace. To do so, use
   <a href="../CAAWsmQuickRefs/CAAWsmSetWs.htm">
   adl_set_ws</a>.</li>
   <li>Once this second file system representation is associated with the 
   workspace, it can be filled with files coming from the other side. To do so, 
   use
   <a href="../CAAWsmQuickRefs/CAAWsmRefresh.htm">
   adl_refresh</a>.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>If you consider that one workspace can have two file system representations, 
 it is possible to work on only one platform at a time. When you work on 
 one platform and you need to work on the other one, two commands can prove 
 useful:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Register the content of your current working workspace. To do so, use the 
   dedicated command
   <a href="../CAAWsmQuickRefs/CAAWsmPhoto.htm">
   adl_photo</a> or any command which leads to data transfer between workspaces 
   (<code><font color="#008040">adl_sync</font></code>, <code>
   <font color="#008040">adl_promote</font></code>).</li>
   <li>Project the files corresponding to this photo to the other side:</li>
 </ol>
 <blockquote>
   <ul>
     <li>Open the same workspace on the other platform</li>
     <li>Run
     <a href="../CAAWsmQuickRefs/CAAWsmRefresh.htm">
     adl_refresh</a>.</li>

 <h4>Listing Checked-out or Private Files</h4>
 <p>This command lists the files you have checked out since the last photo of 
 your workspace, a photo is done each time you ask for it (<code><font color="#008040">Source 
 Code Management-&gt;Information-&gt;Photo</font></code>) or when you exchange data 
 with another workspace (promotion, synchronization). Note that the command 
 lists <a href="#private_file">private files</a> too.</p>
 <p>To list checked-out or private files, select <code><font color="#008040">
 Information-&gt;List Checked-out files</font></code> from the <code>
 <font color="#008040">Source Code Management</font></code> menu.</p>

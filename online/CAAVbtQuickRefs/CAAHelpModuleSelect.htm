<p><u><strong>With this popup you can generate Visual Studio projects from modules or frameworks.</strong></u></p>

<p>Selected modules and frameworks will appear in your Visual Studio workspace.</p>

<p>By checking the workspace, you generate projects for all its frameworks and
modules.  By checking a framework, you generate projects for itself and all its
modules.  You can individually select modules thereby limiting the number of
projects generated in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>A greyed check means that only part of
its constituents have been selected.  A black check mark indicates that all
of the object's constituents have been selected.</p>

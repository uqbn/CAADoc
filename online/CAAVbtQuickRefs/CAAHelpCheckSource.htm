<p><u><strong>With this popup you can define parameters for source checking</strong></u></p>

<p>You need to select the configuration to be used. A configuration is a list of
programming rules and conditions to check in the source code. A list of default
configurations is available, And you need to select one of them as &quot;Basic
onfiguration&quot;. You can overload this basic configuration with a predefined
user configuration. You can display informations of the resulting configuration
(basic + user overload) with the button &quot;Show configuration's
details&quot;.</p>

<p>You need also to select the scope for analysis: You can check all sources of all
frameworks and all modules in your current workspace, or just analyse one framework, or
one module, or even just one source.</p>

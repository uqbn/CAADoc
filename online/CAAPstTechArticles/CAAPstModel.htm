<h3><a name="PSTModel"></a>The Product Structure Model</h3>
<p>A <i>product </i>is something that can be designed, manufactured and produced
within an industrial context. A product can be a car, a vacuum cleaner or a
drill, for example.</p>
<p>A product is made up of different <i>components</i>. When you design a
product, you must determine what components are to be used to create it. Then,
each component must be designed in turn. The <b>ProductStructure framework </b>is
an organizational and management tool allowing the assembly of the different
components making up the final product. This assembly yields a product structure
in the form of a tree.</p>
<p>Components making up a product may themselves be products. It is worthwhile
to design a product from components that can be reused, because then, once a
component has been created in the form of a product, it can be reused as a
component for other products as well.</p>
<p>In CATIA Version 5, there exists a specific type of document dedicated to the
management and storage of data related to a product structure. It is called a
CATProduct document and it is created with a specific <i>root product</i>. The
branches of the product structure all start from this root product object.</p>
<p>So, basically, to create a product structure, you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a CATProduct document</li>
  <li>Retrieve the root product element of this document</li>
  <li>Add as many new components (in the form of other products or of parts) to
    the root product or to other products already defined</li>
  <li>Add as many more components as you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>A component is an <b>instance</b> of either an existing CATProduct or CATPart
document or V4 Model, or of an &quot;in place&quot;- created CATProduct or
CATPart document. Only CATPart and CATProduct documents can be used since only
their structure contains a root product. An &quot;in place&quot;-created
document must also be saved as a separate entity. The document corresponding to
the imported component is called the <b>reference</b>. A part or product in a
product structure is defined by two names:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the<b> reference name, </b>also called the <b>Part Number</b>, is the name
    of the root product element of the reference document, and</li>
  <li>the <b>product instance name </b>is the name of the particular instance of
    the document that is imported as a component.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that if two new components are imported from the same reference
document, they will have the same reference name, or Part Number, but different
instance names.</p>

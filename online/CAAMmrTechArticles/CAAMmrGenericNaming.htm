<h3><a name="Objectives of GN"></a>Objectives of Generic Naming</h3>
<p>In V5, a feature cannot reference directly a topology as a specification [<a href="#References">1</a>].
The main raison is that geometry and topology can be deleted and replaced during
an update. In fact topological objects are unstable.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. The use has created a sweep that uses the
resulting edge of a spline feature as a profile. Suppose now, that the sweep
references the edge directly using its geometrical tag. Whenever the user
modifies the spline, the topology is deleted and replaced by a new one that may
have a different tag.</p>
<p>The tag used by the sweep is now referencing an element that no longer
exists. The sweep cannot be recalculated.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrGN1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The solution implemented in V5 to overcome this problem is to use a name
instead of a direct reference to the topology. In our example [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>], instead
of pointing directly to the edge, the sweep will store a name that describe
precisely this cell, for instance &quot;result edge of the feature
Spline.1&quot;. Even after an update the sweep will be able to find the correct
topology in the result by interpreting the name.</p>
<p>Such a name is called a <b>generic name </b>or a stable name. It provides a
stable way to reference a topological cell. Generic names are managed by the
Generic Naming layer of the V5.</p>
<p>Generic names can be made persistent and stored in some specific features,
called BRep features. BRep features are always hidden to the end-user. They are
aggregated by other features and are used as input specifications. The interface
to manage these features is <i>CATIMfBRep</i>  (MechanicalModeler).</p>

<h3><a name="Principles"></a>Principles</h3>
<h4><a name="Interactive selection"></a>Interactive Selection</h4>
<p>When a user selects interactively a topological cell, CATIA automatically
calculates a generic name for this cell and stores it in a temporary object.
This object is an object of selection (not a feature) managed by the <i>CATIBRepAccess</i>
interface (MecModInterfaces). This object of selection is a temporary handler on the
cell. From an object of selection it is possible to access the feature that own the cells
or the cell itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CATIA calculates the generic naming by reading a kind of history graph of the
topological objects. This graph describes the construction relations that exist
between the cells of several bodies.</p>
<h4><a name="GN Graph"></a>Generic Naming Graph</h4>
<p>The graph used by the generic naming is generated during the update process.
The purpose of this graph is to help the application to build generic names for
selected elements. This graph is made of scopes and nodes.</p>
<p>To each mechanical feature is associated with only one scope. The scope makes
the link between the feature and its topological result (a <i>CATBody</i>). A
scope contains one or several nodes. Each node is linked to a cell of the result
<i>CATBody</i>.</p>
<p>A node can also reference a node of a different scope is there is a
construction relationship between the two cells. Nodes that do not have ancestor
relationship can have a complementary info that helps in identifying the node.</p>
<p>In the example below, we show a simplified view of the graph generated by a
Sketch and a Pad. In this figure [<a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a>],&nbsp;the node (n1) which is linked to
the side face of the Pad (the one in gray) references the node (n2) which is
linked to the Line.1of the Sketch. This relationship expresses the fact that the
face has been generated from the line.</p>
<table border="0">
 <caption><i><a name="Fig.3">Fig.3</a>: Generic Naming Graph</i></caption>

  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrGN3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In this example, the generic name of the grayed face will be: Face generated
by Pad.1, from the edge of Sketch.1/Line.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can see that every side face of the Pad will have a different name.
However, it is not possible to distinguish the top and the bottom face of the
Pad. Both are built using the same elements. In that case it is necessary to add
some information to the nodes of the top and bottom faces.</p>
<p>For a Pad, the top face will have the complementary information Top and the
bottom face will have the info Bottom.</p>
<table border="0">
<caption><i><a name="Fig.4">Fig.4</a>: Added Information</i></caption>

  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrGN4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This added info will be used to build the generic name. In our example the
name of the top face will be: Face generated by Pad.1 with info Top.</p>
<p>Not all the cells of a <i>CATBody</i> needs to be tracked by the nodes of a
graph. In the above example, we can see that each edge is shared by only two
faces. Therefore it is possible to identify an edge by saying that it is the
common edge between two given faces.</p>
<p>Therefore, the generic naming graph will no keep track of every topological
cells. It will only follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The faces of a solid</li>
  <li>The boundary edges and the faces of a shell</li>
  <li>The extremity vertices and the edges of a wire.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Graph generation"></a>Graph Generation</h4>
<p>The graph is generated during the update process of the Part document. Each
mechanical feature is responsible for the generation of its own scope and nodes.
This is generally done in the <code>Build</code> method of the <i>CATIBuild</i>
interface [<a href="#References">3</a>].</p>
<h4><a name="Featurization"></a>Featurization</h4>
<p>To be used as a specification, the object of selection that contains the generic name
must be transformed in a persistent object called a BRep feature. This process
is called the featurization. It is the topic of the next paragraph.</p>
<h3><a name="BRep Feature Management"></a>BRep Feature Management</h3>
<h4><a name="BRep Features and Objects"></a>Object of Selection versus BRep Features</h4>
<p>An object of selection is a temporary object that is returned when the user selects or
pre-selects a geometry. A BRep feature is a persistent object that stores the
name of a topological cell. This name can be used later on to retrieve the cell.
Only a BRep feature can be referenced as an input specification by another
feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <i>CATPathElement</i> (Visualization) can return BRep object. It
will never return a BRep feature. The <i>CATIFeaturize</i> interface can be used
to create a BRep feature from an object of selection.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i>&nbsp; (DialogEngine)
instead of <i>CATPathElementAgent</i> (DialogEngine) to generate automatically a
BRep feature from a selected cell.</p>
<h4><a name="Options for Featurization"></a>Options for Featurization</h4>
<p>Several options are available when performing a featurization either manually
using <i>CATIFeaturize</i> or automatically using a <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i>
. These options are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#F mode">MfNoFeaturization, MfRelimitedFeaturization OR
    MfFunctionalFeaturization</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Support Feature">MfSelectingFeatureSupport, MfLastFeatureSupport
    OR MfInitialFeatureSupport</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Tempo versus Perm Body">MfTemporaryBody OR MfPermanentBody</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Duplicate versus no duplicate">MfDuplicate OR MfNoDuplicate</a></li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="F mode"></a>Featurization mode</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>MfNoFeaturization</b>, indicates that the acquisition agent should not
    create a BRep feature, but should only create an return a BRep object. <i>CATIFeaturize</i>
    must be called afterwards to get a BRep feature.</li>
  <li><b>MfRelimitedFeaturization, </b>indicates that the featurization should
    be performed in relimited mode. This option should be used when the
    boundaries (or the shape) of the selected cell is important (fillet, draft,
    projection)</li>
  <li><b>MfFunctionalFeaturization, </b>indicates that the featurization should
    be performed in functional mode. This option should be used when the shape
    of the selected cell is not important (support plan of a sketch).</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Support Feature"></a>Support Feature</h5>
<p>This option will determine which feature (or scope) will be used to solve the
BRep name and find the pointed cell.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MfSelectingFeatureSupport:</b> indicates that the support of the BRep
    feature should be the selected feature. It means that the cell pointed by
    the Brep will always belong to the selected feature.</li>
  <li><b>MfLastFeatureSupport: </b>indicates that the support of the BRep
    feature should be the one where the selected cell appeared with the same
    shape for the first time.</li>
  <li><b>MfInitialFeatureSupport: </b>Indicates that the support of the BRep
    feature should be the one that has created the selected cell without taking
    into account any modification.</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Tempo versus Perm Body"></a>Temporary versus Permanent Body</h5>
<p>This option will determine is the BRep feature should have its one scope.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MfTemporaryBody:</b> with this option the BRep feature will have an
    incomplete scope. The BRep cannot be used as an input specification of a
    procedural report.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>MfPermanentBody: </b>with this option the BRep feature will have an
    complete scope and can be used in a procedural report. In other words, the <i>CATBody</i>
    of the feature can be used by a topological operator [<a href="#References">3</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="Duplicate versus no duplicate"></a>Duplicate versus No Duplicate</h5>
<p>This option should not be set. The default value should always be used.</p>
<h5><a name="Example"></a>Example</h5>
<p>Here an example to illustrate the options:</p>
<table border="0">
<caption><i><a name="Fig.5">Fig.5</a>: Supported Options</i></caption>

  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrGN5.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Suppose that the user has selected the face in gray, in the result body of
the Hole (Hole.1). Now let's consider the creation of a BRep feature from this
selected cell.</p>
<p>The <b> first</b> option will determine if the BRep should point specifically on the
relimited geometry of if is should point on the functional, in that case both
faces will not be distinguish.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Relimited featurization: The BRep will point specifically on the left cell
    of the Hole.1 (the one in gray)</li>
  <li>Functional featurization: The BRep will point on both faces without any
    possibility to distinguish them</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b> second</b> option (support type) will determine which feature is used to
search for the cell</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selecting feature support: the support feature is the hole, the cell
    returned by the BRep will be the one referenced by the hole. if the hole is
    deleted then the BRep will dangle.</li>
  <li>Last feature support: the support feature is the last feature where the
    cell has been modified. here it will be the Pocket. This is the most stable
    option for a relimited featurization</li>
  <li>Initial feature support: the support feature is the first feature that
    contains the cell. here it will be the Pad. This is the most stable option
    for a functional&nbsp; featurization</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually BRep will be created using one of the two sets of options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functional&nbsp; featurization + Initial feature support</li>
  <li>Relimited featurization + Last feature support</li>
</ul>

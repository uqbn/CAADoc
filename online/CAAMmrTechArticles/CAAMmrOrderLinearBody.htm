<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>The ordered surfacic features set (an Ordered Geometrical Set) and the solid
and surfacic features set (Body) are geometrical features set [<a href="#References">1</a>] introducing two
concepts:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#Order Concept">Order</a></li>
  <p>The goal is having a set inside which features are ordered from the basic
  features (top) to features with huge historical graph (bottom). To reach it, a
  rule has been defined: &quot;Each feature inside an ordered set can only have
  as input specifications features which are above it&quot;. The introduction of
  the <b>current feature</b>, which already exists for PartBody features,
  enable us to implement this rule. This article describes in details the role
  of the current feature.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="#Absorption Concept">Absorption</a></li>
  <p>The goal is having a set inside which only the relevant features are taken
  into account. There are those modifying other features. Their visualization
  makes useless the visualization of the modified features, since they are
  superimposed. The modified features are further named <b>absorbed</b>
  features, and the modifying feature are named <b>absorbent</b> features. This
  article details which they are, and how they behave.&nbsp;</p>
</ol>
<p>In all the CAA documentation, Ordered Geometrical Set and Body features, are also named
<b>ordered sets</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, all screen shots have been done on an Ordered Geometrical
Set. But of course you will have the same behaviors with a Body.</p>
<h3><b><a name="Order Concept"></a></b>Order Concept</h3>
<p>To force the end user to locate his features in a &quot;logical&quot; order
into an ordered set, a feature can only rely on features (inputs) which are
above it. However, this rule is only valid for inputs in the same set as the
feature itself, otherwise, they can be below.&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0">
  <caption><a name="Fig.2">Fig.2</a> Input Specification Order</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSOrder.jpg" width="446" height="302"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In this above picture, <a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>, <code>Line.1</code> can
have <code>Point.1</code> and <code>Point.5</code> as inputs, but not <code>Point.6</code>,
since it is below <code>Line.1</code>.</p>
<p>Specific behaviors have been implemented to help the end user to respect the
previous rule when designing its geometry.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#When editing a feature, it becomes the current feature">When
    editing a feature, it becomes the current feature</a></li>
  <li><a href="#A new feature is inserted just after the current feature">A new
    feature is inserted just below the current feature.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#The input specifications of the current feature can be only features above it in the specification tree">The
    input specifications of a feature can be only features above it in the
    specification tree</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Only the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer">Only
    features above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are detailed these four behaviors.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a name="When editing a feature, it becomes the current feature"></a>When

    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSCurrent.jpg" width="537" height="354"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>When <code>Line.1</code> is edited, it becomes the current feature such as
  shown by the above picture <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a>. The name of the current
  feature is underlined in the specification tree, such as using the
  &quot;Define in Work Object&quot; interactive command.</p>
  <li><a name="A new feature is inserted just after the current feature">A new
    feature is inserted just below the current feature</a></li>
  <p><code>Line.1</code> is the current feature, and you create a point. The new
  feature, <code>Point.7</code>, will be inserted just below <code>Line.1</code>, as shown on <a href="#Fig.4">Fig.4</a>,
  and not below <code>Plane.1</code>, the last feature of the ordered set. In a Geometrical Set (a non ordered surfacic
  features set), <code>Point.7</code>
  would have been automatically aggregated at the end of the set.</p>
  <table border="0">

      Current Feature</caption>
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSNewFeat.jpg" width="483" height="330"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>This
  behavior enables the end user to locate its new feature into the ordered body
  in order to respect the top /down order: when editing <code>Point.7, </code>only
  the same authorized features as at the creation time will be displayed and
  available.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>
    <p><a name="The input specifications of the current feature can be only features above it in the specification tree">The
    input specifications of a feature can be only features above it in the
    specification tree</a> (if inputs are selected in the same set)</p>
  </li>
  <p><a name="The CATFeatureImportAgent behavior has been modified">The <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i>
  </a>is an agent of selection mainly used in the Part and Product context. It
  has been modified to enable the end user selecting only the features above the
  current feature.</p>
  <table border="0">
    <caption><a name="Fig.5">Fig.5</a> Feature Below the Current Feature are not

    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSnosele.jpg" width="630" height="341"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>On this above picture <a href="#Fig.5">Fig.5</a>, <code>Line.1</code> is
  being edited. When you try to replace <code>Point.5</code> by <code>Point.6,</code>
  which is below <code>Line.1</code> in the specification tree, the following
  tool tip is displayed.</p>
  <p>In the case of the creation of a feature, since the <a href="#A new feature is inserted just after the current feature">new
  feature is inserted just below the current one</a>, the order rule will be
  kept.</p>
  <p>T<a name="The CATFeatureImportAgent behavior has been modified">he <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i>
  </a>agent can prevent the selection of features inside the same set. But you
  can always select a feature from another body below or above the current one,
  i.e. in another set.</p>
  <p>At last, it must be specified that this rule of selection is only an
  interactive rule. By code, there is no protection on interfaces modifying the
  inputs of features.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a name="Only the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer">Only
    the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer</a></li>
  <p>The following <a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a> shows the 3D viewer when all the
  elements of the ordered set are visible.</p>
  <table border="0">
    <caption><a name="Fig.6">Fig.6</a> The Last Feature of the Ordered
      Body&nbsp; is the Current One</caption>
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSAllElt.jpg" width="517" height="317"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>It is the last element of the set which is the current feature, so all
  elements of the surfacic features set are drawn.</p>
  <p>Now, if you observe <a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a> where <code>Line.1</code> is
  the current feature, from <code>Point.1</code> to <code>Line.1</code> the
  features in the ordered set are visualized, but neither <code>Extrude.1</code>,<code>
  nor Point.6, </code>nor <code>
  Plane.1</code> are drawn.</p>
  <table border="0">
    <caption><a name="Fig.7">Fig.7 </a>Features Below the Current Feature are

    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSCurrentLine.jpg" width="449" height="304"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>So if you are editing <code>Line.1</code>, you are not disturbed by the
  features located below it, and you cannot select them in the 3D viewer.
  Consequently, you cannot &quot;break&quot; the order rule by selecting in 3D.</p>
</ol>
<p>The current feature enables us to manage the location of features into ordered
sets, to ensure a coherence into the specifications, and avoid to
visualize the useless features when editing one. The current feature is managed
by <i>CATIPrtPart</i>, an interface implemented by the Part feature [<a href="#References">1</a>].</p>
<h3><a name="Absorption Concept"></a>Absorption Concept</h3>
<p>Compare the following two pictures in <a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a>.</p>
<table border="0">
  <caption><a name="Fig.8">Fig.8</a> Absorbent Feature</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSPartwithGS.jpg" width="292" height="259"></td>

</table>
<p>Both show the split of a surface (<code>Extrude.1) </code>by a plane (<code>Plane.1)</code>-
see <a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a>. The 3D visualization of the result seems equal:
you only see <code>Split.1</code>, and <code>Extrude.1</code> is not visible.
But if you have a look to the specification tree, you can remark that on the
left picture, <code>Extrude.1</code> has the hidden icon, and on the right, its
icon is normal. It means that if you swap the visible space, <code>Extrude.1</code>
of the Geometrical Set (on left) will be drawn, while <code>Extrude.1</code>
inside the OGS or Body will not be.</p>
<p>Once <code>Split.1</code> is created, <code>Extrude.1</code> is visually
useless for the design. <code>Split.1</code> is said to be an <b>absorbent</b>
feature. It means a feature which modifies one or several features. Conversely, <code>Extrude.1</code>
is named an <b>absorbed</b> feature.</p>
<p>There are six behaviors or concepts to consider:</p>

</ol>
<p>Here are detailed these behaviors.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="The current feature is the absorbent feature or one below it in the specification tree"></a>Absorbed
    Feature Visualization</li>
  <p>The visualization of the absorbed feature is depending on the current
  feature position:</p>
  <table border="0">

    <tr>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><a href="#Fig.9">Fig.9</a> shows the three cases detailed below:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Case 1</b>: The current feature is above the absorbed feature
      (excluded)&nbsp;</li>
    <p>It is the general rule which is applied: <a href="#Only the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer">Only
    features above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer</a>.
    Consequently, <code>Extrude.1</code> is not visualized. See <a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>
    for an example.</p>
    <li><b>Case 3</b>: <a name="The current feature is between the absorbed feature and its absorbent feature (except it)">The
      current feature is between the absorbed feature (included) and its
      absorbent feature (excluded)</a></li>
    <p>On <a href="#Fig.10">Fig.10</a> <code>Point.6</code>, the point
    between <code>Extrude.1</code> (absorbed feature) and <code>Split.1 </code>(absorbent
    feature), is the current feature.</p>

    </table>
    <p>You can notice that <code>Extrude.1</code> is displayed. At this time (<code>Point.6</code>
    current) of the history of the set, <code>Extrude.1 </code>has not
    been yet modified by <code>Split.1</code>.&nbsp;</p>
    <li><b>Case 2</b>: The current feature is the absorbent feature (<code>Split.1</code>)
      or one feature below it.</li>
    <p>The <a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a> shows that the absorbed feature, <code>Extrude.1,</code>
    is not drawn.</p>
  </ul>
  <li><a name="Absorbed Features Selection">Absorbed Features Selection</a></li>
  <p>Try to create an offset of <code>Extrude.1</code> just below the Split
  operation <a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a>. It will be impossible to select <code>Extrude.1</code>
  whereas <code>Extrude.1</code> is above the new offset.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i> has been modified to prevent the selection
  of an absorbed feature. Thus, possibility to select in the specification tree
  is compliant with what is drawn in 3D. See the previous <a href="#The current feature is the absorbent feature or one below it in the specification tree">Absorbed
  Feature Visualization</a> section.</p>
  <li><a name="Absorbent Feature Insertion">Absorbent Feature Insertion</a></li>
  <p>Suppose that just after the Split operation of <code>Extrude.1</code> by <code>Plane.1</code>
  <a href="#Fig.8">Fig.8</a> (after: time notion), you want introduce a
  modification of <code>Extrude.1</code> to do before the first Split (before:
  location sense). To do that, first you set current <code>Extrude.1</code> or <code>Plane.1</code>,
  and then you create <code>Plane.2</code> and <code>Split.2.</code> Here is the
  result of this scenario.</p>
  <table border="0">

      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAMmrOGSReroot1.jpg" width="369" height="241"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Since <code>Split.2 </code>is created between <code>Split.1</code> and <code>Extrude.1</code>,
  <code>Split.1</code> relies on <code>Split</code>.<code>2</code> and no more<code>
  Extrude.1</code>.<code> </code>Before this operation, the input of <code>Split.1</code>
  was <code>Extrude.1</code>, but after it is <code>Split.2</code>. The
  Parent/Children command shows that:</p>
  <table border="0">
    <caption><a name="Fig.13">Fig.13</a> Parent-Children&nbsp;</caption>
    <tr>
      <td>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>This modification of <code>Split.1 </code>is managed by a mechanism of
  &quot;<b>re-root</b>&quot; in the ordered set. When <code>Split.2</code> is
  added into the ordered set, (added = the <code>Append </code>method of <i>CATIDescendants</i>),
  a re-root call is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This &quot;re-root&quot; mechanism is based on the <code>Insert</code> method of the <i>CATMmrLinearBodyServices</i>
  class. It must be invoked <b>whatever the type of the feature</b> aggregated
  in the ordered body is. It means for the absorbent feature, but also for the
  other one. This <code>Insert</code> method must also be invoked if you reorder
  features inside such set, or if you change the inputs of a surfacic features
  (useless for solid features).</p>
  <p>Before calling this <code>Insert</code> method, the feature must be
  updated.</p>
  <li><a name="CATIInputDescription, the interface to define the type of the feature"></a>CATIInputDescription,
    the interface to define the type of the feature</li>
  <p>The <i>CATIInputDescription</i> interface enables you to two things:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Define the type of the feature</p></li>
    <ol>
      <li><b>creation</b>: the feature creates matter. A GSD Line is a creation
        feature.</li>
      <li><b>modification</b>: the feature modifies another feature. A GSD Split
        is a modification feature.</li>
      <li><p><b>Contextual</b>: the feature creates matter but is closely
        associated with a specific feature. A GSD Offset is a contextual
        creation feature, it creates geometry contextually to a master feature.</p></li>
    </ol>

  <li><p>Define what are the absorbed features among the inputs [<a href="#References">5</a>]
    of an absorbent feature</p></li>
    <ol>
      <li>The list of absorbed features</li>
      <p>The Split feature, an absorbent feature, has only one input. So it has
      only one absorbed feature. But if you take the Trim, or the Assemble features,
      they have several inputs.&nbsp;</p>
      <li>The main input&nbsp;</li>
      <p>Among the absorbed features of an absorbent one, one is declared such as the main. See the role of this feature in the next

      section.</p>
    </ol>

  <p>The &quot;Contents of the Specification Container - Geometrical Features&quot; article [<a href="#References">3</a>]
  explains in details this interface and the role of each methods, and the
  &quot;Integrating a New Mechanical Feature in V5&quot; article [<a href="#References">4</a>]
  explains for each kind of feature you must implement it.&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a name="The Main Absorbed Feature">The Main Absorbed Feature</a></li>
  <p>Among the inputs of an absorbent feature, one of these absorbed features is privileged. This feature has two roles:</p>

        </tbody>

      <p>The color of Feat3, a feature of modification which has two inputs, is

      </table>
      <p>If Feat4, a feature of modification, is moved before Feat3, the input
      of Feat4 becomes Input2 (the main input).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <a name="Result of the Body">Result of an Ordered Set</a></li>
  <p>Absorbed features do not have only visual behaviors. They do not appear in
  the result of an ordered set. The <i>CATIBodyRequest </i>[<a href="#References">2</a>]
  interface which returns the result of a geometrical features set will do not include
  the absorbed (no relevant) features.</p>
</ol>
<p>Finally to finish with the absorption concept, it is the <i>CATIInputDescription</i>
 interface which gives the type of the feature, and in case of absorbent feature
(feature of modification), this interface specifies the absorbed inputs and the
main absorbed feature.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In V5R13, Mechanical Modeler has renamed Open_Body in Geometrical Set,
      and introduced the Ordered Geometrical Set. The objective of this article is

<h3><a name="Part1"></a>Ordered Geometrical Set versus Geometrical Set</h3>
<p>Up to V5R13, the elements structuring [<a href="#References">1</a>] a Part
document are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Part object</li>
  <li>The Body/PartBody objects</li>
  <li>The Open_Body objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In V5R13, two main modifications appear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Open_Body</b> is renamed <b>Geometrical Set</b></li>
  <li>The <b>Ordered Geometrical Set </b>object is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Geometrical Set (GS) and the Ordered Geometrical Set (OGS) are both GSMTool
features. This means that both of them are surfacic bodies, and contain surfacic geometrical
features [<a href="#References">2</a>].</p>
<p>The GSMTool feature has been &quot;typed&quot; to
be either a  Geometrical Set or an Ordered  Geometrical Set. This type is materialized by the downwards arrow on the icon
representing the Ordered Geometrical Set in the specification tree.</p>

<p>In an interactive session, you can create either a Geometrical Set or an
Ordered Geometrical Set using the Insert menu.</p>
<p>The
Ordered Geometrical Set has been introduced to simplify the management of the
links between features when the Part has a huge historical graph. The Geometrical Set
staying always adapted for features with few history or without input
specification (datum [<a href="#References">2</a>]).</p>
<p>Two main notions have been defined on the GSMTool to
form an
Ordered Geometrical Set:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#Ordered Set">Ordered Body</a></li>
  <p>The
  goal is having a body inside which features are <b> ordered</b> from the basic
  features (top) to the more complex features (bottom). To reach it, a rule has
  been defined:
  &quot;Each feature inside an Ordered Geometrical Set can only have as input
  specifications features which are above it in the same set&quot;. The
  introduction of the current feature, which already exists for solid bodies (Part/PartBody), enable us to implement this rule.</p>
  <li><a href="#Absorbent Feature">Absorbent Feature</a></li>
  <p>The notion of absorbent feature is a novelty. There are features modifying
  other features. Their visualization makes useless the visualization of the
  modified features, since they are superimposed. Consequently, in an Ordered Geometrical Set,
  the modified features, named further absorbed and which are intermediate features, are not drawn.</p>

</ol>
<p>These two notions are detailed below.</p>
<ol><li><b><a name="Ordered Set"></a>Ordered Body</b> </li>

  <p>To force the end user to locate his features in a &quot;logical&quot; order into the
  ordered surfacic body, a feature can only rely on features (inputs) which are above
  it in the same body. It is the rule in order to have an ordered body.</p>

  <p> In this above picture, <a href="#Fig.2"> Fig.2</a>, <code>Line.1</code>
  can have <code>Point.1</code> and <code>Point.5</code> as inputs, but not <code>Point.6</code>,
  since it is below <code>Line.1</code>.</p>

  <p>Specific behaviors have been implemented to help the end user to respect the
  previous rule
  when designing its geometry.</p>

  <p>When <code>Line.1</code> is edited, it becomes the current feature such as

  <p>In a Geometrical Set, <code>Point.7</code>  would have been automatically

  the following tool tip is displayed.</p>

  <p>In the case of the creation of a feature, since the n<a href="#A new feature is inserted just after the current feature">ew
  feature is inserted just below the current one</a>, the order rule will be
  kept.</p>

  <p>T<a name="The CATFeatureImportAgent behavior has been modified">he <i>CATFeatureImportAgent</i>  </a>
  agent can prevent the selection of features inside the same body. But you can always
  select a feature from another body below or above the current one, i.e. in
  another body.</p>

  <p>At last, it must be specified that this rule of selection is only an
  interactive rule. By code, there is no protection on interfaces modifying the
  inputs of features.</p>

  <li><a name="Only the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer">Only
    the feature above the current feature are visualized in the 3D viewer</a></li>
  <p>The following <a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a> shows the 3D viewer when all the

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>It is the last element of the body which is the current feature, so all
  elements of the surfacic body are drawn.</p>
  <p>Now, if you observe <a href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>
  where <code>Line.1</code> is the current feature, from <code>Point.1</code> to <code>Line.1</code> the features in the
  Ordered Geometrical Set are visualized, but not <code>Extrude.1</code>,<code>
  Point.6 </code> or <code>Plane.1</code>.</p>

  <p>So if you are editing <code>Line.1</code>, you are not disturbed by the
  features located below it, and you cannot select them in the 3D viewer.
  Consequently, you cannot &quot;break&quot; the order rule by selecting in 3D.</p>
 
   </ol>
  <p>The current feature enables us to manage the location of features into the
  surfacic body, to ensure a coherence into the specifications, and avoid to
  visualize the useless features when editing one. The current feature is managed by <i>CATIPrtPart</i>, an interface
  implemented by the Part feature [<a href="#References">1</a>].</p>

  <p>Both show the split of a
  surface (<code>Extrude.1) </code>by a plane (<code>Plane.1)</code>- see <a href="#Fig.4">Fig.4</a>. The 3D visualization of the result
seems equal: you only see <code>Split.1</code>, and <code>Extrude.1</code> is
  not visible. But if you have a look to the specification tree, you can remark that on the left
  picture, <code>Extrude.1</code>
has
  the hidden icon, and on the right, its icon is
  normal. It means that if you swap the visible space, <code>Extrude.1</code>
of the
  Geometrical Set (on left) will be drawn, while <code>Extrude.1</code> inside the Ordered Geometrical
  Set
  will not be.</p>
  <p>Once <code>Split.1</code> is created, <code>Extrude.1</code> is visually
  useless for the design. <code>Split.1</code>  is said to be an absorbent feature.
  It means a feature which modifies one or several features. Conversely, <code>Extrude.1</code>
  is named an absorbed feature.</p>

  This modification of <code>Split.1 </code>is managed by a mechanism of feature <b>insertion</b>
  in the Ordered Geometrical Set.</p>

  <p>This mechanism is based on the <code>Insert</code> method of the <i>CATMmrLinearBodyServices</i>
  class. It must be invoked whatever the type of the feature aggregated in the Ordered Geometrical
  Set is. It must also be invoked if you reorder features inside an OGS, or if
  you change their inputs.</p>

  <li><a name="Result of the Body">Result of the Surfacic Body</a></li>
  <p>Absorbed features do not have only visual behaviors. They do not appear in
  the result of the surfacic body. The <i>CATIBodyRequest </i>[<a href="#References">3</a>]
  interface which returns the result of a mechanical body will do not include
  the absorbed (intermediate) features.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally to finish with the absorbent features, it is the <i>CATIInputDescription</i>
  interface which gives the type of the feature, and in case of absorbent
  feature (feature of modification), this interface specifies the absorbed inputs.</p>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, the Ordered Geometrical Set is a kind of surfacic body introduced <b>to channel
their contents,</b> by imposing the orders of creation of features, and <b>to</b>
 <b>avoid drawing the intermediate features</b>. It should help the
designer to create the object to be built.</p>

<p>This section has presented to you the main behaviors of the Ordered Geometrical
Set. You are encouraged to read the article about the structural elements [<a href="#References">1</a>]
to find out a more technical information.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="Part2"></a>What does it Imply for Applications?</h3>
<p>The introduction of the Ordered Geometrical Set may imply modifications on
your existing code. This section has been built to resolve all the
questions that you must you ask according to the kind of application.</p>
<p>Here are the four kind of applications:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read Part Contents</li>
  <p>The first level enables you to consult the contents of a Part document in
  order to perform analysis or to do data transfers. You should know how
  to <b> retrieve</b> the elements, and their geometrical <b>result</b>, of an Ordered Geometrical Set.</p>
  <p>The interface to use is obligatorily <b><i>CATIBodyRequest</i></b>. This
  interface returns all the geometrical features of the Ordered Geometrical Set
  excepted the absorbed features (see the <a href="#Absorbent Feature">Absorbent Feature</a> section). Nevertheless, if you need all the
  aggregated geometrical features of the set, you can always use the <code>GetDirectChildren</code>
  method of <i>CATIDescendants</i> with the <i>CATIGeometricalElement3D</i>
  interface as filter.</p>

  <p>The referenced article [<a href="#References">3</a>] explains the result of a
  surfacic body, the usage of the <i>CATIBodyRequest</i> interface, and how to
  retrieve the topological result (<i>CATBody</i>) of each element contained
  into the surfacic feature.</p>

  <li><a name="Geometrical Feature Instantiation">Geometrical Feature Instantiation</a>
    and
    Usage</li>
  <p><b>a/ </b> If you are an application instantiating<b>,</b> and not defining, Dassault Systemes
  (DS) or CAA surfacic features. Your problem is <b> where</b> and <b> how</b>
  to store a new
  instantiation.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a name="You do not want store instances in Ordered Geometrical Set.">You do not want
    to support Ordered Geometrical Set.</a></li>
  <p>Once you have retrieved a <code>GSMTool</code>, checked it was not an Ordered
  Geometrical Set, <b>aggregate</b> the new feature in the surfacic body thanks
  to <i>CATIDescendants.</i></p>
  <p>If your application uses the <i>CATIGSMProceduralView</i>
  interface, you should no more use the <code>InsertInProceduralView</code> 
  method which accepts the insertion of features in Ordered Geometrical
  Set.</p>
  <li><a name="You accept to store the newly feature in any kind Geometrical Set (ordered or not)">You
    choose to benefit of the Ordered Geometrical Set</a></li>
  <p>This option is possible only if the feature to insert can be stored in an Ordered Geometrical Set.
  For any surfacic DS feature it is possible, for a CAA feature verify that it
  implements <i><a href="#CATIInputDescription">CATIInputDescription</a></i>.</p>
  <p>Once you have retrieved a <code>GSMTool</code>, if it is a Geometrical Set you <b>aggregate</b>
  the new feature with <i>CATIDescendants</i>,<i> </i>otherwise
  you <b>insert</b> the
  new feature in the Ordered Geometrical Set by the following methodology:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Aggregate the feature in the body with the <i>CATIDescendants</i>    interface</li>
    <ul>
   <li>At the end of the body, if the current feature is not inside this body
    (with the <code>Append</code> method)</li>
   <li>After the current feature otherwise</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Update the new instance</li>
   <li>Call <code>Insert</code>, the static method of the <i>CATMmrLinearBodyServices</i>
    class</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
     <ul>
  <p>If your application uses the <i>CATIGSMProceduralView</i>
  interface, you can keep the usage of the <code>InsertInProceduralView</code> 
  method. This method manages the aggregation according to the type of the
  surfacic body. For an Ordered Geometrical Set, the second (update) step
  and the third (<code>Insert</code>) step remain your job.</p>
    </ul>
  <p>You can you refer to the Combined Curve use case [<a href="#References">4</a>],
  where the two choices have been implemented.</p>

  
  
  <p><b>b/</b> If you are an application modifying the contents of surfacic bodies, you
  should take care of the <i>CATIDescendants</i> usage. If you aggregate (see
  just previously), move, or modify features inside an OGS, you should then call the <code>Insert</code> method of the <i>CATMmrLinearBodyServices</i>
  class to ensure the linearity into the set.</p>

  
  
  <li>User Feature and Power Copy Usage [<a href="#References">5</a>]</li>
  <p>If you have an application instantiating Power Copy or User feature, you
  have nothing to do since the software of instantiation automatically manages
  the insertion into a body whatever its type. However, if you have implemented the <i><b>CATIEdit</b></i>
  interface on your &quot;typed&quot; user feature you should
  set as current the edited instance, and restore the old current feature
  once the edition is ended. You can refer to the CAAMcaUdfEdition use case [<a href="#References">10</a>],
  for a detailed implementation.&nbsp;</p>

  
  
  <li>CAA Geometrical Feature Creation</li><p>For those which have
  created a CAA Geometrical StartUp [<a href="#References">6</a>] or want create
  a new one, the only one question is <i>&quot;Do I want to store my feature in an Ordered
  Geometric Set&quot; </i>?</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You accept to store your feature in an Ordered Geometrical Set</li>
  <p><a name="CATIInputDescription"></a>You have to implement the <i><b>CATIInputDescription</b></i>
  interface on your StartUp. This interface enables you to define the type of
  the feature, absorbent feature or not, and to define its &quot;absorbed&quot;
  inputs.</p>
  <p>On the CAA StartUp you have implemented a set of interfaces to complete or
  overload behaviors of a geometrical feature [<a href="#References">8</a>], and
  one of them is the <i><b>CATIEdit</b> </i>interface to edit the feature. You should
  set as current the edited instance, and restore the old current feature
  once the edition is ended.</p>
  <p>In interactive command creating new instance of your CAA StartUp:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> First you must check
  that the storage (aggregation + insertion if necessary) into the set is correct depending on the type of
  the surfacic body (refer to the second case of the &quot;<a href="#Geometrical Feature Instantiation">Geometrical Feature Instantiation</a>&quot;
    section) </li>
  <li>Secondly, do not forget to set as current the new instance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> You can refer to the Combined Curve use case for the implementation of the
  <i>CATIInputDescription</i> interface [<a href="#References">7</a>] and the
  creation and edition command [<a href="#References">9</a>].</p>
  
  <li>You do not accept to store your feature in an Ordered Geometrical Set</li>
  <p>You must check that all commands creating new instances do not allow
  to store new instances in Ordered Geometrical Set. Refer to the first case
  of the &quot;<a href="#Geometrical Feature Instantiation">Geometrical Feature Instantiation</a>&quot;
  section.</p>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>Up V5R13, the surfacic body, a mechanical feature deriving from the GSMTool
StartUp, can be either a Geometrical Set, or an Ordered Geometrical Set. The
distinction is retrieval by the <code>GetType</code> method of the <i>CATIGSMTool</i>
interface. An Ordered Geometrical Set is characterized by the two following
notions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ordered body</b>
    <p>Each feature can only rely on features aggregated above it in the
    specification tree; when the input specifications are into the same body.</p>
  <li><b>Absorbent feature</b>
    <p>Feature modifying one or more of its input specifications, is named a
    feature of modification. It is also named an absorbent feature because its
    modified features are like absorbed since they are not drawn in 3D, they do
    not appear in the result of the surfacic body.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For an existing or a new application, the most important things to retain
are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <i>CATIBodyRequest</i> to retrieve the result of a surfacic body,</li>
  <li>Implement <i>CATIInputDescription</i> on your CAA StartUp to take benefit
    of the Ordered Geometrical Set possibilities,</li>
  <li>Invoke the <code>Insert</code> method after each modification on inputs of
    features aggregated into an OGS,</li>
  <li>Manage the current feature in your interactive command if you have
    accepted to integrate your CAA feature into an OGS.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="What does mkmk for you">What does mkmk for you?</a></h3>
<h4><a name="Developing is more interesting than building">Developing is more 
interesting than building</a></h4>
<p>Before being able to see the result of what he has written, the developer 
must build his program with the appropriate compiler and linker. This is not a 
simple task especially when one must take into account various locations of 
source files, multiple operating systems, several languages, multiple compilers 
with different and numerous options and so on. Those who have experienced 
makefiles management know the problem...</p>
<p>With mkmk, the Workbench proposes a single tool to compile and link 
applications wherever the user is working and whatever the
<a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMANMkmk.htm">programming language(s) 
used</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="Hide operating system specificities">Hiding operating system </a>
specifics</h4>
<p>mkmk offers the same independence from the development platforms as CNext 
components: they offer the same interfaces and methods no matter whether you're 
writing code for NT or Unix platforms.</p>
<p>It's the same with mkmk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>same development data for all platforms</li>
  <li>same location (workspace) for all operating systems with all platforms
  <ul>
    <li>source files stay at the same place</li>
    <li>generated data is placed in its <em>operating system</em> directory</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>same way of running
  <ul>
    <li>whatever the language(s)</li>
    <li>whatever the operating system</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Supported platforms and operating systems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows NT 4.0
  <ul>
    <li>Intel architecture</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unix
  <ul>
    <li>AIX, HP-UX, SunOS</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Support of component-oriented design">Supporting component-oriented 
design</a></h4>
<table border="0" cellspacing="6">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="40%">mkmk recognizes the CAA organization of 
    components, the structure of frameworks and modules has no secret for it. 
    mkmk lets the developer work at the framework/module level, specifies what 
    are the components he's really working on and what prerequisite frameworks 
    he needs (prerequisite frameworks which services are used by his own 
    frameworks).</td>
    <td valign="top" width="60%">
    <img border="0" src="images/fw_mod.gif" width="279" height="239"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>One can consider that users think of component organization and dependencies 
while mkmk translates their meaning into concrete information on files and 
directories. For example, a user needing services offered by framework X to 
implement his own framework will just declare that X is a prerequisite framework 
for him, then mkmk will find the related libraries (regarding the current 
operating system) and header files which are needed for compilation.</p>
<p>Two special files are strongly related to frameworks and modules and are 
analyzed by mkmk:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IdentityCard.h</strong> [<a href="#References">1</a>]: associated 
  with each framework and gives the name of the prerequisite framework(s)</li>
  <li><strong>Imakefile.mk</strong> [<a href="#References">2</a>]: associated 
  with each module and explains what must be produced from this module<br>
  (executable, shared library, archive, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Support of concurrent engineering">Supporting distributed data</a></h4>
<p>Concurrent engineering is mainly supported by the WSManager that allows 
people to share and integrate data in workspaces. However, WSManager commands 
are used to copy files into a workspace and it is not a good idea to have copies 
of all frameworks in every workspaces. To avoid this situation the user can set 
up a special path by specifying one or several workspace root directories where 
mkmk will look in to find prerequisite frameworks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The whole set of frameworks can be dispatched among number of workspaces (this 
  is done by WSManager commands)</li>
  <li>Any user, inside his workspace, needing prerequisite frameworks, specifies 
  the location of workspaces containing the frameworks he needs. This 
  information is used by mkmk to find out the corresponding libraries and header 
  files to achieve the local compilation (prerequisite resources stay in their 
  own workspace, no copy is performed).</li>
  <li>Any user decides whether the access to prerequisites should be static (isolated 
  work) or dynamic (impacted by prerequisite changes). This is explained below.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Principles of use">Principles of use</a></h3>
<h4>mkmk<a name="Mkmk and the CAA FileTree"> and the CAA FileTree</a></h4>
<p>The aim of this section is to explain where to find mkmk special files and 
what directories and files are managed by the tool.</p>
<h5 align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/FileTree13.gif" width="439" height="479"></h5>
<p align="left">Note that you must have one IdentityCard.h file per framework 
and one Imakefile.mk file per module.If your framework does not need any 
external service, its identity card will be empty, otherwise it will contain 
references to the corresponding frameworks. The minimum required for the 
Imakefile.mk file is to contain the type of data which must be produced from the 
container module: consult the <a href="CAABtlMANIdCard.htm">Imakefile.mk</a> 
article to learn its syntax.</p>
<p align="left">As said before, mkmk recognizes frameworks and modules inside 
the CAA FileTree, it means that you can run mkmk in any directory (somewhere 
under the root directory) and it will build what corresponds to this level.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="How to start with mkmk">How to start with </a>mkmk</h4>
<p><em>My first program!</em></p>
<p>Before to compile a program with mkmk, some things must exist. Here is the 
smallest file tree you can have if you use mkmk, Our example consists in a 
single source file just to say &quot;<em>Hello World</em>&quot;.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/FileTree15.gif" width="439" height="399"></p>
<p><a name="My first compilation!"><em>My first compilation!</em></a></p>
<p>The first thing to know is where is mkmk. Considering that mkmk has been 
installed under &lt;mkmk&gt; directory, you should execute the following command to 
set up your path:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><strong>Unix platform</strong></td>
    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#00FFFF"><strong>NT platform</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">Open a shell window</td>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">Open a DOS window</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">Enrich your shell path<br>
    <code><em>.</em> <em>&lt;mkmk&gt;</em></code>
    <p>Ask your tools administrator to get the exact installation path.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">Enrich your DOS environment<br>
    <code><em>&lt;mkmk&gt;</em></code>
    <p>On NT, the exact installation path may be given under UNC format (<code>//machine/shared_name/...</code>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Once your path has been updated, next commands are the same no matter <u>
whether you're working on NT or on UNIX</u> (AIX, HP-UX, SunOS operating 
systems).</p>
<p>The first compilation should be global to be sure to build all what is needed: 
in the example below, we go under the framework we want to build and run mkmk 
with option -a to compile all what can be find under it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code><em>$ cd &lt;workspace_root_directory&gt;/Hello<br>
  $ mkmk -a<br>
  ...</em></code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If our example had two modules, we could choose to compile just one of them 
by giving its name to mkmk:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code><em>$ cd &lt;workspace_root_directory&gt;/Hello<br>
  $ mkmk hello.m<br>
  ...</em></code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We propose the reader to consult the mkmk<a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMANMkmk.htm"> 
reference page</a> to know all about the mkmk options.</p>
<p><em>Where is my program?</em></p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">When a compilation is successfully completed, its results (programs 
    or libraries) can be found under a related OS directory. For our &quot;hello&quot; 
    example, we should get a &quot;hello&quot; program on Unix platform and a &quot;hello.exe&quot; 
    program on NT platform.</td>
    <td valign="top"></td>

<h4><span lang="en-us"><a name="New build step checking interfaces usage"></a>
New build step checking interfaces usage</span></h4>
<font face="Arial">
<p><span lang="en-us">A new build step has been added to mkmk to check the 
interfaces architecture. This new step will check two rules:</span></p>
<h5><span lang="en-us">1 - A Public interface can only use other Public

</font>
<h4>mkmk<a name="Mkmk compilation phases"> compilation phases</a></h4>
<p>When you run mkmk (whether to compile a framework or a module), the 
compilation goes through four main steps. These steps can be controlled using 
specific mkmk <a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMANMkmk.htm#Usage">
options</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identity Card compilation<br>
  mkmk processes the (container) framework Identity Card</li>
  <li>Header list generation<br>
  mkmk computes the list of headers made public by the (container) framework</li>
  <li>Build Time Data update<br>
  mkmk (re)generates makefiles used during step 4</li>
  <li>The build itself<br>
  two passes for shared libraries, to successfully build a series of them</li>
</ol>
<p>Note about step 4:<br>
two passes are needed when several libraries must be produced from a framework 
because they may call each others, so they are first built (standalone) and then 
missing symbols are resolved. If you decide to build shared libraries one by 
one, you may encounter some &quot;unresolved symbols&quot; problems, in such cases, run 
mkmk on the whole framework, all modules will be treated in the right order.</p>
<h4><a name="How to access prerequisite frameworks">How to access prerequisite 
frameworks</a></h4>
<p>Prerequisite frameworks are frameworks which services are used by your own 
frameworks, by the way you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>at build time, to access the corresponding header files (compilation) and 
  libraries (link),</li>
  <li>at run time: to access the corresponding (shared) libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way you specify where to find prerequisite data is based on workspaces 
and more precisely on workspace root directories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>before to start the first build, use the command
  <a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMkOthers.htm#mkGetPreq">mkGetPreq</a> 
  to specify the root directory (ies)of the workspace(s) managing the framework(s) 
  you need</li>
  <li>during the compilation, mkmk goes under the specified directory (ies) to 
  find the header files and libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as prerequisite data are stored in a CAA FileTree, the root directory 
is enough for mkmk, no need to specify the exact location of each files.</p>
<p>More than one workspace can be referenced to look for prerequisite frameworks, 
this is done by setting a &quot;prerequisite path&quot; :</p>
<ul>
  <li>prerequisite workspaces are specify from the most interesting to the less 
  interesting, i.e. if a framework exists in several workspaces, take it from 
  the first specified</li>
  <li>in a same way, if the first workspace does not contain a prerequisite 
  framework, mkmk will look for it in the second one, and so on, until to find 
  it (if no one contains the framework, mkmk will raise an error).</li>
</ul>
<p>As anybody is able to choose his own prerequisite workspace(s), we advice the 
users to decide what are the &quot;reference&quot; workspace(s), otherwise this situation 
may lead to real problem during integrations of developments. A safety way for a 
workspace to reference prerequisite frameworks is to used those defined by its 
father workspace.</p>
<h4><a name="Run a program">Running a program</a></h4>
<p>Here are some pointers for those who are developing CNext applications. The 
purpose of the following commands is to set up the user environment in order to 
access the right resources and libraries (remember that applications are mainly 
composed of shared libraries and that a wrong search path could lead to load a 
wrong library at runtime):</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMkOthers.htm#mkCreateRuntimeView">
  mkCreateRuntimeView</a>: this command is used to install application resources 
  (icons, message files, ...) from every frameworks to a single place.</li>
  <li><a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMkOthers.htm#mkrun">mkrun</a>: 
  this command runs CNext based applications with parameters, the search path is 
  set up to access libraries, taking into account the path that was set up 
  before, for the compilation, to access the prerequisite frameworks. This 
  ensures that you use the same libraries both at buildtime and at runtime. This 
  command can be used also to attach a debugger to the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mkrun command is not the only way to run programs which are developed and 
built in a CAA FileTree but in any cases, you must take care of your search path 
to be sure to use the right libraries.</p>
<h3><a name="Tips and hints">Tips and hints</a></h3>
<p>This section is intended for people having started with mkmk and who know a 
little bit more about mkmk capabilities.</p>
<h4>Skip mkmk compilation steps</h4>
<p>If you know that neither the IdentityCard.h file, nor the Imakefile.mk file, 
nor prerequisite frameworks have changed, then try the option -nomk. Derived 
objects will be produced faster.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code><em>$ mkmk -nomk</em></code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Choose between dynamic or static access to prerequisites</h4>
<p>We told you that
<a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMkOthers.htm#mkGetPreq">mkGetPreq</a> 
is the command to specify the location of prerequisite frameworks, in fact there 
is another command (named
<a href="../CAABtlQuickRefs/CAABtlMkOthers.htm#mkCopyPreq">mkCopyPreq</a>) 
which can be used to copy these frameworks locally. This can be useful if you 
don't want to be impacted each time your prerequisites changed. However, the 
choice between static and dynamic access must be decided at team level (and not 
by each user) in order to have a proper integration.</p>
<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In short</h3>
<ul>
  <li>mkmk is the CAA compiler, it is available with both NT and UNIX platforms, 
  with same options and behavior, native compilers are hidden to simplify user's 
  tasks.</li>
  <li>Two files must be managed by the developer: <em>IdentityCard.h</em> is 
  defined for each framework and specifies the prerequisite frameworks, <em>
  Imakefile.mk</em> is a template defined for each module and specifies what 
  must be produced by it (a shared library, an archive or an executable).</li>
  <li>mkmk allows the user to reference and dynamically access multiple 
  workspaces to search for prerequisite frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before to start, we advise the developer to consult the papers describing the 
mkmk special files where it can find additional information on how he can 
control the way mkmk works (see below).</p>

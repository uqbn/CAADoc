<h3><a name="100000"></a>What Is XML ?</h3>
<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a data description language. XML
has many strengths, which account for its great popularity and large
availability:<br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It has a simple text syntax based on elements identified by start
	and end tags. One can read or create XML easily with just a simple text
	editor.</li>
	<li>It supports pluggable grammars (called DTDs or XSD schemas), which
	enable the creation of tag vocabularies for any domain.</li>
	<li>It is very strictly standardized by the W3C (World Wide Web
	Consortium), which makes XML the ideal vehicle to exchange data among
	heterogeneous systems.</li>
</ul>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="110000"></a>Anatomy of an XML Document</h4>
<p>XML documents are composed of elements, delimited by a start tag (of
the form <code><b>&lt;</b>element_name<b>&gt;</b></code>) and an end tag (of
the form <code><b>&lt;/</b>element_name<b>&gt;</b></code>). Elements can
contain either other elements or free text. Every XML document has one
and only one root element, which contains all the other elements. The
following XML sample is provided to illustrate the anatomy of an XML
document.</p>
<p><img src="images/xmlsample.png" alt='xmlsample.png (15916 bytes)' width="630" height="360"></p>
<p>The following syntactic constructs are the most common in XML
documents.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The XML declaration</dt>
	<dd>It identifies the document as XML. Note the mandatory XML version
	number (1.0) and the description of the encoding (UTF-8) used by the
	document. XML documents can use any encoding, provided that the XML
	parser used to process the document knows how to deal with the
	encoding.</dd>
	<dt>The document type declaration</dt>
	<dd>It identifies the DTD (tag vocabulary) used by the XML document and
	the tag name for the root element ("car"). This vocabulary is stored in
	an external file with the .dtd extension (automotive.dtd), though it
	can also be in-lined in the document. The document type declaration is
	optional and tends to be gradually replaced by another equivalent but
	more powerful mechanism, called XSD schemas.</dd>
	<dt>The root element</dt>
	<dd>An XML has one and only one root element (called "car" here).</dd>
	<dt>Elements</dt>
	<dd>An element is identified by a start tag and an end tag. If the
	element has no sub-elements, the syntax can optionally be abbreviated
	to just one tag, as for the &quot;wheel&quot; element. Notice the
	trailing '/' in this case.</dd>
	<dt>Attributes</dt>
	<dd>The start tag can contain attributes, which are (name, value) pairs
	qualifying the element. Attribute names are unique within the tag
	scope. Attribute values appear within quotes. "body" is the value of
	the attribute called "name" of the "part" element.</dd>
	<dt>Characters</dt>
	<dd>XML elements can also contain free text.</dd>
	<dt>Entities</dt>
	<dd>XML use entities to escape reserved characters or specify
	characters not supported by the document code page. The "&amp;lt;"
	entity is use here to escape the "&lt;" reserved character.</dd>
	<dt>Comments</dt>
	<dd>XML documents can be annotated with comments.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other syntactic constructs (CDATA sections, processing instructions,
etc.) can occasionally appear in XML documents. For a complete
description of the XML syntax, please refer to <a href="#Ref1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="120000"></a>Well-formedness and Validity</h4>
<p>XML files follow syntactic rules, some of which were just described
in the <a href="#100000">previous section</a>: there must be one and
only one root element; attribute names must be unique within an element
start tag scope; reserved XML characters such as '&amp;' and '&lt;' must
be properly escaped, etc. An XML document, which obeys these syntactic
rules is said to be <b>well formed</b>.</p>


<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
&lt;car>&lt;part name="engine">&lt;/car>&lt;/part>
                                ^
                                |
   Not well-formed XML: the tags are not properly nested.
          </pre></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


<p>The elements, which are allowed to appear in an XML documents and the
order in which these elements are allowed to appear is described by a
grammar file, called a DTD or an XSD schema. An XML document, which
obeys all the rules specified by its associated grammar file is said to
be <b>valid</b>.</p>

<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE car SYSTEM "automotive.dtd">
&lt;car>
 &lt;part name="engine">&lt;/part>
 &lt;aeroplane name="spitfire"/>
&lt;/car>     ^
           |
           |
 Well-formed but invalid XML: aeroplane is not defined in the automotive DTD.
          </pre></td>

<h3><a name="200000"></a>Presentation of the Core XML Standards</h3>
<p>The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is the standard body in charge of
XML. The W3C does not only take care of the standardization of the
language itself (see <a href="#Ref1">[1]</a>); it also offers
standardized programming APIs to manipulate XML documents. Aside from
the W3C, other programming APIs have become very popular to the point of
becoming de facto standards. Note that though XML is very stable and
upward compatibility will be assured, the standard keeps evolving with
revisions of the specifications (XML 1.1, XSD 1.1) or the apparition of
newer programming paradigms.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="210000"></a>De Jure Standards (W3C): XML 1.0, Schemas 1.0,
DOM</h4>
<p>The following list presents the official W3C standards:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>XML 1.0</dt>
	<dd>XML 1.0 specifies the syntax for the XML language. It also
	specifies the syntax of the historic XML grammar format, known as DTDs
	(Document Type Definition). For more information, see <a href="#Ref1">[1].</a></dd>
	<dt>XML namespaces</dt>
	<dd>XML namespaces are a set of element naming patterns and attribute
	naming patterns. They enable the creation of documents, which mix
	elements from several vocabularies. Through the use of a prefix-based
	syntax and URIs, which uniquely identify vocabularies, namespaces avoid
	name clashes between identically named elements originating from
	different vocabularies. For more information, see <a href="#Ref2">[2].</a></dd>
	<dt>XSD 1.0 schemas</dt>
	<dd>The XSD specification (XML Schema Definition) was designed as a
	replacement for DTDs. Schemas represent an improvement over DTDs in
	several areas. First, XSD schemas are XML files themselves, which
	provides greater coherency. Second, XSD schemas have a very
	sophisticated type system and can express constraints using regular
	expressions or define relational integrity constraints. For more
	information, see <a href="#Ref3">[3].</a></dd>
	<dt>DOM 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0</dt>
	<dd>DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming API to read,
	manipulate and write XML documents. The core specification explains how
	to operate on XML documents as if they were trees of typed nodes.
	Complementary extensions to the specifications cover related utility
	APIs. For instance, extensions include "DOM traversal" (iterations
	through a XML document), "DOM range" (definition of selections), "DOM
	load/save" (persistence). For more information, see <a href="#Ref4">[4].</a></dd>
</dl>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="220000"></a>De Facto Standards: SAX</h4>
<p>Originally invented by David Megginson as a library for the Java
programming language, the SAX API has become very popular and can be
considered as a de facto standard. Many vendors provide their own
implementation of SAX for various languages and the specification has
already undergone one major evolution (SAX 2.0). For more information,
see <a href="#Ref6">[6].</a></p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="300000"></a>XML for the Developer</h3>
<p>Developers wanting to create, access or manipulate data stored in XML
have APIs at their disposal. This section gives an overview of the DOM
and the SAX APIs, while the <a href="#410000">next section</a> discusses
the strengths and weaknesses of each API.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="310000"></a>A Document-oriented API: DOM</h4>
<p>The DOM API uses an object-oriented approach to describe XML
documents. The DOM API defines interfaces to represent each of the
constructs available in the XML language: elements, attributes,
documents, characters, entities, comments, etc. These interfaces have
inheritance relationship (a &quot;comment&quot; is a specialized form of
&quot;character data&quot;). The inheritance hierarchy is rooted at the
abstract &quot;node&quot; class. The following diagram shows the DOM V5
interface hierarchy.</p>
<p><img src="images/domhierarchy.png" alt='domhierarchy.png (8328 bytes)' width="640" height="435"></p>
<p>The DOM API views XML documents as a tree of XML nodes. The root
element of the XML document corresponds to the root of the DOM tree. The
sub-elements of the root element are the children of this root node. The
following sample shows the DOM tree which corresponds to a sample XML
document.</p>
<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE car SYSTEM "automotive.dtd">
&lt;car>
 &lt;!--list of parts for a convertible car-->
 &lt;part name="seat" quantity="2">&lt;/part>
 &lt;part name="wheel" quantity="4"/>
 &lt;part name="engine" quantity="1">low consumption engine&lt;/part>
 &lt;part name="body" quantity="1">weight must be &amp;lt; 1200 kg&lt;/part>
&lt;/car></pre></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p><img src="images/dominstance.png" alt='dominstance.png (7116 bytes)' width="630" height="280"></p>

<p>The DOM API defines methods to parse documents (build the in-memory
tree, which corresponds to an XML document), manipulate document (insert
elements, edit attribute values, copy or delete sub-trees, etc.), and write
documents (generate XML from an in-memory DOM tree).</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="320000"></a>An Event-oriented API: SAX</h4>
<p>The SAX API uses an event-oriented API to process XML documents. The
XML SAX parser reads XML documents sequentially and emits one typed
event for each XML construct it comes across: start of the document,
start of an element, end of an element, comment, characters, etc.
Programmers register callback functions with the SAX parser for the
events they are interested in. Usually, programmers will need to store
the generated events in a stack in order to keep track of the location
of the event in the XML tree. The following list shows the SAX events,
which are generated for a sample document.</p>

<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE car SYSTEM "automotive.dtd">
&lt;car>
 &lt;!--list of parts for a convertible car-->
 &lt;part name="seat" quantity="2">&lt;/part>
 &lt;part name="wheel" quantity="4"/>
 &lt;part name="engine" quantity="1">low consumption engine&lt;/part>
 &lt;part name="body" quantity="1">weight must be &amp;lt; 1200 kg&lt;/part>
&lt;/car></pre></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>
1. Start document
2. Start element "car"
3. Start element "part", attributes {"name=seat", "quantity=2"}
4. End element "part"
5. Start element "part", attributes {"name=wheel", "quantity=4"}
6. End element "part"

12. End element "part"
13. End element "car"

<h3><a name="400000"></a>Choosing the Right API</h3>
<p>XML often provides more than one mechanism to address the same
problem. Choosing the right mechanism is a matter of understanding its
trade-offs in terms of performance, ease of development, supported
features, etc.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="410000"></a>DOM Versus SAX</h4>
<p>The main advantages of DOM are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DOM is easy to understand.</li>
	<li>You do not have to create an object model of your own to store the
	data in memory, since DOM already provides one with its tree model.</li>
	<li>DOM is very good at document manipulation: removing a sub-tree,
	changing attribute values or duplicating a portion of one document in
	another is very easy with DOM.</li>
	<li>DOM lets you create XML documents, not just read existing ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main weaknesses of DOM are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DOM uses a lot of memory.</li>
	<li>DOM cannot work with not well-formed or invalid XML data. If the
	document is not well-formed, the DOM tree cannot be built.</li>
	<li>Navigation in the DOM tree can be tricky. For instance, if two
	elements are separated by white space in an XML document (even a
	carriage return), a CATIDOMText will be inserted between the two
	CATIDOMElements, which is not very intuitive (humans have a natural
	tendency to skip the white space and consider the elements
	consecutive).</li>
</ul>

<p>The main advantages of SAX are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>SAX can parse arbitrarily big XML files. It does not use a lot of
	memory and is faster than DOM.</li>
	<li>SAX can recover from errors (not all of them though) and allow the
	processing of incorrect XML documents to continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main weaknesses of SAX are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>SAX does not support the creation of XML files. It is designed for
	parsing only.</li>
	<li>SAX is not as widespread as DOM and has no standard body backing
	it. Some platforms (.NET for instance) do not support it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, <b>use DOM if</b> you need to manipulate files no larger
than a few megabytes or if your application uses XML itself as the data
model. Typical candidates would be storing settings in XML, or
manipulating contents in XHTML. <b>Use SAX if</b> you need to manipulate
arbitrary large files or if you need to map you own object model to XML.
Typical candidates would be persistency of an object graph in XML, or
processing large log files containing events generated by a server.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="420000"></a>DTDs Versus Schemas</h4>
<p>DTD and schemas address the same problem: defining tag vocabularies
(grammars) for XML documents. They are to XML documents what the
description of tables and relationships is to a relational database. The
following example shows how an XML grammar defined as a DTD. The grammar
defines two elements (car and part). The part element element can have
two attributes ("name" and "quantity"). Several "part" elements can be
nested inside a "car" element. Part elements can contain text.</p>

<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT car (part)+>
&lt;!ELEMENT part (#PCDATA)>
&lt;!ATTLIST part name ID #REQUIRED
          quantity CDATA #IMPLIED></pre></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here is an equivalent grammar defined as an XSD schema:</p>
<table class="code">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
 elementFormDefault="qualified" 
 targetNamespace="urn:com:dassault_systemes:automotive" 
 xmlns:tns="urn:com:dassault_systemes:automotive">
 &lt;xsd:element name="car">
  &lt;xsd:complexType>
   &lt;xsd:sequence maxOccurs="unbounded">
    &lt;xsd:element name="part" type="tns:partType"/>
   &lt;/xsd:sequence>
  &lt;/xsd:complexType>
 &lt;/xsd:element>
 &lt;xsd:complexType name="partType">
  &lt;xsd:simpleContent>
   &lt;xsd:extension base="xsd:string">
    &lt;xsd:attribute name="name" type="xsd:ID" use="required"/>
    &lt;xsd:attribute name="quantity" type="xsd:positiveInteger"/>
   &lt;/xsd:extension>
  &lt;/xsd:simpleContent>
 &lt;/xsd:complexType>
&lt;/xsd:schema></pre></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>The main advantages of DTDs are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DTDs are simple and easy to understand.</li>
	<li>DTD is the historic grammar format for XML and has thus good
	diffusion and broad support.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main weaknesses of DTDs are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DTDs use yet another syntax.</li>
	<li>DTDs cannot express complex relationships or type constraints. DTDs
	do not have the concept of data type so everything is viewed as text.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The main advantages of XSD schemas are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schemas are very powerful. They have a rich type system. They have
	a relational integrity constraint definition mechanism close to the one
	of a relational database. They support regular expressions.</li>
	<li>Schemas are written in XML themselves. All the XML manipulation
	tools can thus be reused for schemas.</li>
	<li>Schemas can be created to replace existing DTDs: All the DTD
	constructs have an equivalent XSD schema construct. Tools exist to do
	the conversion automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main weaknesses of XSD schemas are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>XSD is a complex standard. Writing good XSD schemas requires
	experience and tools. A good introductory text for XSD schemas is
	referenced here <a href="#Ref5">[5]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, your choice for DTDs or schemas will first depend on what
is available: make the list of the products you need to integrate and
choose a grammar language supported by all the systems. <b>Use DTDs if</b>
if you are new to XML and want to get started quickly; if you need to
develop a prototype and do not want to spend much time on a grammar; if
you need to integrate with a system, which only supports DTDs. <b>Use
schemas if</b> you need a precise definition of your data model; you
have tools or expertise to help you define the schema.</p>

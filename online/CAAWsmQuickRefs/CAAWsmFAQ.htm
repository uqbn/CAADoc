<h3><a name="Commands"></a>SCM commands Location</h3>
<h4>Where are SCM commands?</h4>
<p>The environment path is set when executing the SCM profile. Consult [<a href="#References">1</a>]
or ask your SCM administrator for the command to run for setting your path.</p>
<h4>Some commands are available but not all those listed in the documentation</h4>
<p>SCM commands are grouped in two sets regarding their purpose: user commands
or administrator commands. Check what profile you did run when setting up the
environment.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Environment"></a>SCM Database Environment</h3>
<h4>The dynamic link library OCI.dlll could not be found...</h4>
<p>This message is displayed on Windows platform and this occurs when the client
part of the Oracle product has not been installed on the user workstation. Ask
your SCM administrator for checking
<ul>
  <li>whether Oracle has been installed on the workstation</li>
  <li>and the value of the ADL_LIB_DBMS variable against the Oracle installation
    [<a href="#Ref3">3</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4># ADLDB - 0001: Database error: Database = ...: ORA-12154: TNS:could not
resolve service name</h4>
<p>The database identifier which is known by SCM must also be known by the
underlying DBMS. This means that some Oracle configuration files have not been
updated according to the SCM database. Contact your SCM administrator to correct
this problem.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Attach"></a>Attach</h3>
<h4>I want to attach a component but SCM tells me that this component cannot be
found</h4>
<p>Check first that the component you need is managed in the same tree as your
workspace. If not, you can create a new workspace in the right tree (adl_mk_ws)
or declare your workspace in the right tree using the adl_link_ws command. If
you are working in the right tree, read the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Like for any modifications, the creation of a component is not automatically
seen by any workspace. A given workspace can see a component only if its parent
workspace can see it. If this component exists in your parent workspace, you
must wait it is published and then synchronize your workspace (adl_sync), you
will be able to attach the component. If the component does not exist in your
parent workspace, run the command<code> adl_ls_fw -all -ws ws_name</code> for
your parent workspace. If the component does not appear in the list, it means
that your parent workspace is not synchronized with the right level of its own
parent workspace (and so on).</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="File"></a>File</h3>
<h4>The adl_mk_elem command is refused for some files</h4>
<p>Check if the files have suffixes. If not, execute the adl_ls_type command to
find out the predefined types/suffixes and choose one corresponding to your
file(s), then run again the adl_mk_elem command using the -type option to
specify the file type. If files have suffixes, may be those suffixes are not
recognized by SCM (not listed by the adl_ls_type command), then you can choose a
type/suffix having the same characteristics as your files or ask your SCM
administrator to create a new type/suffixe using the adl_mk_type command.</p>
<p>The adl_mk_elem can be also canceled if someone else has created the same
file in another workspace (may be this file is now deleted). You can force the
creation of your file by setting the -force option when running the adl_mk_elem
command.</p>
<p>If you want to create a file which has been already created in another
workspace but this workspace has not yet delivered this file, you can import the
creation using the adl_import command. It is better to import a creation than
forcing a second creation because forcing the creation will lead to a merge when
the two files will appear in the same workspace.</p>
<h4>There are strange characters in some files</h4>
<p>When a file is registered in SCM, its content type is determined regarding
its suffix (text or binary). When a text file is transfered from Windows-NT to
Unix (for instance using the adl_refresh command), its internal format is
changed because lines end with a double carriage return on Windows-NT and a
simple one on Unix. If the file was classified as a binary file, this treatment
is not performed while transfering from Windows-NT to Unix. To check the type of
a file, run the command <code>adl_ls_out filename -all</code>. If the file is
classsified as a binary file, you need to create it again using the right type:
<ul>
  <li>remove the file using the adl_rm command</li>
  <li>create again the file using the adl_mk_elem command and set the -force
    option as the same file cannot be created twice (by default).</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Missing files and"></a>Missing files and directories</h3>
<h4>I have promoted by workspace and it has been collected but some files and
directories are missing in my parent workspace</h4>
<p>Perhaps you forgot to declare these files and directories in SCM. Run the
adl_chk command in your workspace to find out all unmanaged files and
directories. Then create them using the appropriate command (adl_mk_elem,
adl_mk_fw, adl_mk_mod, adl_mk_data, ...) and promote your workspace again.</p>
<h4>The traces of my last synchronization show that new files were coming but I
do not see them on my file system</h4>
<p>You have synchronized your workspace having a current working image (this one
was refreshed) but now you are looking at another image and it is not refreshed
against your workspace. Run the adl_ds_ws command to check the status of each
image and run the adl_refresh command on all images you need to refresh.</p>

<h3><a name="Module"></a>Module</h3>
<h4>Unknown extension</h4>
<table class="code">
  <tr>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>There are two kind of modules that can be created under a framework:
&quot;code&quot; modules and &quot;data&quot; modules. The &quot;code&quot;
modules are creating for storing source files while &quot;data&quot; modules are
used for storing any files.
<ul>
  <li>&quot;code&quot; modules are created by the adl_mk_mod command and must
    have one predefined extension (m, mext, mj, mjext).<br>
    They are used for delivering program source files.</li>
  <li>&quot;data&quot; modules are created by the adl_mk_data command and can
    have any name. However some names have a predefined meaning for CAA tools
    (CNext, CNext.specifics_UNIX, CNext.specifics_Windows_NT) because they are
    used for delivering resources for CAA programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that module extensions must be chosen in a predefined list that can be
changed for a given SCM installation. Ask your SCM administrator to know whether
a custom checker library [<a href="#Ref2">2</a>] has been setup.</p>

<h3><a name="Not an SCM Object"></a>Not a SCM Object</h3>
<h4>I tried to move some files into another directory but my command was
refused.</h4>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>E:&gt; pwd
E:\Workspace\dev\Administration\CNext.specifics_UNIX\code\command</pre>
      <pre>E:&gt; adl_mv * ..\..\Administration\CNext.specifics_SunOS\code\command
Verifying the path &quot;Administration\CNext.specifics_SunOS\code\command&quot;.
# ADLCMD - 0863: &quot;Administration\CNext.specifics_SunOS&quot; <strong>is not an SCM object</strong>.
Choose another target object path.
The target can be an existing SCM object (framework, module, data component or directory) 
or a non existing SCM object to rename the source SCM object to this new name.</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When adl_mv is used for moving several files into another directory , this
directory must be managed by SCM. In the previous example, there are some
intermediate directories to register in SCM before being able to use the adl_mv
command. Depending on the location of a directory in the file tree, the
directory must be declared using either adl_mk_fw, adl_mk_mod or adl_mk_data, or
adl_mk_dir.</p>
<p>In the previous example, assuming &quot;Administration&quot; is a managed
framework, the commands to execute are:
<ul>
  <li>adl_mk_data CNext.specifics_SunOS</li>
  <li>adl_mk_dir code</li>
  <li>adl_mk_dir command</li>
  <li>adl_mv * ..\..</li>
</ul>
<h4>I tried to check-out one file but my command was refused</h4>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>E:\Workspace\dev1\fw1\mod2.m&gt;adl_co Imakefile.mk
Verifying the path &quot;fw1\mod2.m\Imakefile.mk&quot;.
# ADLCMD - 0863: &quot;fw1\mod2.m&quot; <strong>is not a SCM object</strong>.
Choose an existing file path.
The file must be a SCM object.</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If the command is refused by telling that the file must be a SCM object, it
means that that file has not been declared. In such a case it can be directly
edited and then declared to SCM using the adl_mk_elem command. Conversely, if it
is declared first, the -wr option must be used to let the file in checked-out
mode or execute the adl_co command after the registration.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Promotion"></a>Promotion</h3>
<h4>My promotion is refused because it contains a file which has been already
promoted by someone else</h4>
<p>You have three choices:
<ul>
  <li>you wait for the other promotion to be collected in your parent workspace
    and that this workspace publishes, then you can synchronize your workspace
    (adl_sync) for getting the other version of the conflicting file. You will
    have two merge your file with the other one in order to avoid to lose the
    other modifications. Once the merge performed, you can promote your
    workspace.</li>
  <li>you cancel your changes in the conflicting file by using the
    adl_forget_chg command and promote again your workspace. Note that you can
    make a copy of your file before forgetting the changes and you should also
    check that promoting your workspace without this file won't lead to errors
    when your changes will be integrated into the parent workspace (buildtime or
    runtime errors).</li>
  <li>you use the adl_import command on the conflicting file and this will
    produce a merge to solve in you workspace. After having solved the merge,
    the result file should contains your modifications and those done in the
    other workspace, so SCM will allow you to promote the file by setting a
    higher priority on your file because it integrates the other file.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Synchronization"></a>Synchronization</h3>
<h4>My workspace is synchronized but I do not see the same files in my parent
workspace's images</h4>
<p>It means that your parent workspace has either modified these files or got
them by synchronizing itself or collecting other workspaces but didn't
published. You can check your parent workspace's status by running the command <code>adl_ds_ws
parent_ws_name</code>. Wait for your parent workspace to publish and then run
the adl_sync command to synchronize your workspace: you will get these files.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Workspace"></a>Workspace</h3>
<h4>I want to use the same workspace name in two different trees but it is
forbidden</h4>
<p>As multi-tree workspaces can be created, two workspaces having the same name
in two different trees represent the same workspace. If you want to reuse the
name of an old workspace, you can either delete or rename this old workspace.</p>
<h4>I used to access my workspace from a given host but now it is not accessible
and I want to work on my files</h4>
<p>The files one user is working on are just copies from the database workspace
objects. From any host where SCM is available, it is possible to create a new
image of an existing workspace by using the adl_mk_image command. The same files
will be extracted, excepted for those modified on the first host and that have
been checked-in. Images can be created, moved or deleted at any time.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Conflict"></a><b>Locking Conflicts Between Commands</b></h3>
<h4 align="left">My command is waiting for another to finish</h4>
<p align="left">SCM commands put locks on data (workspaces, components,
elements, etc) in order to prevent concurrent accesses. When a command tries to
modify an object that is currently locked by another command, the following
message is displayed and the second command waits until either it is interrupted
or the other command ends.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>E:\&gt; adl_mk_elem main.cpp

  <li>
    <p align="left">the UUID of the lock owned by the process
    (DPyRz++++++3+++9a+72).</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">My command is waiting for another to finish but it does not
finish</h4>
<p align="left">When a conflict message appears, you must wait for the other
command to finish. When the conflict still exists after few minutes, it is
possible that the other command gets in trouble or has stopped but the SCM
monitor is not aware of it.</p>
<p align="left"><u>Case 1: the command is still alive</u></p>
<p align="left">To know if the command is still running, log on the host (<b><font color="#FF0000">randdsy</font></b>)
that is displayed in the conflict message and look for the process which
identifier (<font color="#FF0000"><b>2504</b></font>) is displayed in the error
message.</p>

      <p><b>adl_transfer_mngr</b> is the command corresponding to the SCM
      Multi-site Transfer Manager. The goal of this process is to provide to

<h3><a NAME="Synopsis"></a>Synopsis</h3>
<p>adl_transfer_mngr [<b>-port </b> port_number] [<b>-tmp</b> directory] [<b>-cmdfile</b> filename]
[<b>-ctrlfile</b> filename] [<b>-eventmanager</b> program_path] [<b>-verb</b>] [<b>-h</b> | <b>-help</b> | <b>-?</b>] </p>

<h3><a NAME="Usage"></a>Usage</h3>

<p>The <b>adl_transfer_mngr</b> command is the command to be started but the way
it is launched differs regarding the current operating system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Windows, we provide the adl_admin_site [<a href="#Ref1">1</a>]
    command for declaring a service for the transfer manager.&nbsp;<br>
    In that case we advise to use the service controller to launch the transfer
    manager.</li>
  <li>On UNIX, we provide the adl_start_transfer_mngr.sh [<a href="#Ref2">2</a>]
    program whose purpose is to set up some system parameters before starting
    the transfer manager.&nbsp;<br>
    We advise to use this command rather than adl_transfer_mngr in order to be
    not disturbed by system limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>More than one adl_transfer_mngr can be started on the same host by using a
different port for each of them. However a single manager is enough to manage
several transfers at the same time. It is designed to support multiple connections
from different clients and to manage different working environments at the same
time.</p>

<h3><a name="CommandFile"></a>The Command File</h3>

<p>The command file contains the non SCM commands that a given SCM Multi-site
Transfer Manager can execute. The default file that is delivered on the CD-ROM
contains the all the commands that intersite commands needs. The path to the
default file is &lt;INSTALL_PATH&gt;/<b>OS</b>/code/command/admin/AuthorizedCommands.txt
where &lt;INSTALL_PATH&gt; is the path specified when installing the RADE CD-ROM
and <b>OS</b> a directory the name of which is an acronym that depends on the operating system. Refer to [<a href="#References">5</a>] 
to get the current list of operating systems supported and associated acronyms.</p>

<p>On Windows platform, it is possible than the Multi-site Transfer Manager
cannot be started due to this command file. This error occurs when the
&quot;find&quot; program required by intersite commands is found in
&quot;WINNT\System32&quot; directory instead of &quot;mksnt&quot;. In such a
case, an error message is written by the transfer manager in its trace file [<a href="#Ref3">3</a>]
asking the user to edit the command file and to enter the full path to the
&quot;mksnt&quot; find program.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="ControlFile"></a>The Control File</h3>

<p>The control file is a text file in which the SCM administrator enter the
names of the frameworks and workspace trees he allows other sites to attach
through intersite commands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This file is not required to set up transfers between SCM sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if no file is specified when starting the transfer manager, all frameworks
    and workspace trees will be available for other sites</li>
  <li>if a file is specified, only the frameworks and wokrspace trees that are
    declared in this file will be available for the sites specified in this file
    (see rules below)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rules&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The command file is a text file composed of lines describing the rights for
frameworks and/or workspace trees. Here are the rules to follow to write this
file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a line can be empty or composed of 5 fields separated by a pipe ('|')</li>
  <li>if the first field is empty, the second is filled with the name of a
    workspace tree</li>
  <li>if the second field is empty, the first one is filled with the name of a
    framework</li>
  <li>the third field must be the unique identifier [<a href="#Ref4">4</a>] of a
    SCM site</li>
  <li>the fourth field must be either &quot;GRANT&quot; or &quot;FORBID&quot;
    according to the rights associated with the given framework or tree for the
    given site</li>
  <li>the last field is reserved for comments and can be empty</li>
  <li>if a framework or a tree is to be shared with several sites, there must be
    one line for each site</li>
</ul>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="The Event Manager"></a>The Event Manager</h3>

<p>The &quot;Event manager&quot; is a way for the SCM administrator to follow
connections that are made from other sites to the SCM Multi-site Transfer
Manager of the local site. Indeed it is possible to know the transfers that have
been set up locally using the <a href="CAAWsmLsTransfer.htm">adl_ls_transfer</a>
command but, in the reverse way, we don't know the remote transfers that have
been set up to exchange data with some workspaces of the local site.</p>

<p>The &quot;Event Manager&quot; is a program which is specified when starting
the SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager and which is called automatically each time</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new client is connecting the transfer manager</li>
  <li>a client is closing its connection with the transfer manager</li>
</ul>
<p>The program is called in background and receives - as its single parameter -
the path to a temporary information file.<br>
The program is responsible of deleting this file.</p>
<p>This file contains 7 lines starting with a keyword. There are different
information depending on the command that made the connection. Here are the two
different contents that can be found.</p>
<p>When the client command is an intersite command (<a href="CAAWsmAttachIs.htm">adl_attach_is</a>,
<a href="CAAWsmPromoteIs.htm">adl_promote_is</a>, <a href="CAAWsmSyncIs.htm">adl_sync_is</a>,
etc), here is the content of the information file:</p>

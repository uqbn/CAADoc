<h3><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h3>

<p>The adl_site_transfer command is a user command and can work between any
workspaces of two different sites. It is possible to use workspaces without images, especially on the
remote site where it is advised to have a workspace dedicated to each transfer
and this may require a lot of disk space if all of them own one image.</p>

<p>To start a transfer</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>A distant host must be specified using the -rhost and -rport options:
      the host is the one where the SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager [2] is
      running and the port is the port on which it is listening for clients'
      requests. Note that this remote host may not be reachable from any local
      host since special privileges may be required for accessing the distant
      site (ask your system engineers).</li>
    <li>A string must be given to identify the distant site. That this is not
      necessarily the string returned the adl_ls_site command but rather a
      string that is different for each transfer that is started from the same
      local workspace and targeting different sites. This string is used for
      computing the <a href="#Data sub-directory">name of a directory</a> where
      various data will be stored.</li>
    <li>The remote transfer workspace must be specified using its name. This
      workspace must exists.&nbsp;<br>
      It is possible to specify a working image or to let SCM chooses the
      default one. it is also possible to specify that no image is to be used
      for either saving disk space of because the SCM Multi-site Transfer
      Manager's account does not grant privileges for writing in all workspace's
      images.</li>
    <li>The remote workspace tree must be specified. It is not mandatory to give
      this information if the remote workspace exists in only one tree but this
      avoids the adl_site_transfer command to retrieve these information by
      itself.</li>
    <li>A remote temporary directory must be specified using the -rtmp option.
      It must be a valid directory on the host specified by the -rhost option
      and it must have enough free space for being able to contain (temporarily)
      a large amount of data because source files to receive or to send will be
      copied in it.</li>
    <li>Remote actions must be specified for managing the remote workspace.
      Indeed if the remote workspace exists only for sharing components, no one
      is working in it and it is needed to make changes happen in it:
      <ul>
        <li>the -r_collect and -r_sync options specify the actions to be
          performed before computing the changes to be transferred;</li>
        <li>the -r_publish and -r_promote options specify the actions to be
          performed after receiving changes from the local site.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The local workspace must be specified using its name. This workspace
      must exists.<br>
      It is possible to specify a working image or to let SCM chooses the
      default one. it is also possible to specify that no image is to be used
      because either no one exists or the current user has no right for working
      in one image. Not however that special transfer data have to be stored and
      retrieved for each transfer: those information are stored by default under
      the local workspace's image. If there is no local image, then another <a href="#Data Directory">storage
      directory</a> must be specified using the -lwd option.</li>
    <li>A local workspace tree must be specified. It is not mandatory to give
      this information if the local workspace exists in only one tree but this
      avoids the adl_site_transfer command to retrieve these information by
      itself.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the command is to share frameworks between sites and thus
allowing concurrent developments on the same items. However it is possible than
only one site is allowed to modify the shared frameworks, in that case it is not
needed to import changes from it and the -export_only or -import_only options
can be used to restrict the transfer to one direction and also reducing the time
spent by the command.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Necessary context"></a>Necessary Context</h3>

<p>The adl_site_transfer command works with two workspaces: a local one and a
remote one. The local workspace becomes the current working workspace and then
the current user must have enough rights to work in it. Secondly the remote
workspace is managed by the SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager process; this
process is managed by the SCM administrator of the distant site and must be
started using an account that has rights for managing remote workspaces.&nbsp; </p>

<p> Before
starting a transfer, it is required to attach in both workspaces the frameworks
that are to be shared. Note that if you chose a root workspace as a transfer
workspace, it will be never possible to detach any framework from it. </p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a NAME="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites Commands</h3>

<p>The command calls other SCM commands to perform operations on local and
remote workspaces: synchronization, promotion, collect, publishing, ...&nbsp;<br>
These commands are batch commands and does not need user's help for their
execution. The only command that requires user's help is the adl_solve_merge [<a href="#Ref1">1</a>]
command. It is run automatically when changes coming from the distant site are
in conflict with local changes.<br>
As the transfer manages frameworks that are visible in both workspaces, it is
needed to attach all the frameworks that are to be shared: use the adl_attach
command for that purpose. Note that this step may require help from users of the
distant site if users from the local site have no way to access it and to run
SCM commands. </p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Data Directory"></a>Data Directory</h3>

<p>This directory is used to store data during transfer execution: intermediate
files, temporary files, trace files, etc&nbsp;<br>
It contains also data files that are used for computing delta of changes between
successive transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When no specific directory is specified when running a transfer, the default
directory is taken in the local transfer workspace's image:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>&lt;path to the local transfer workspace's image&gt;</i>/ToolsData/MultiSite</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A specific directory can be specified by the -lwd ('l'ocal 'w'orking 'd'irectory)
option. Note that like for the default directory, this directory must be
writable for the user who runs adl_site_transfer. When such a specific directory
is specified, additional directories are created regarding the associated
transfer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a transfer starting from the local workspace &lt;WS&gt; and the
    associated image &lt;IMAGE&gt;, the path to the data directory is<br>
    <i>&lt;path specified by the -lwd option&gt;</i>/MultiSite/&lt;<i>WS&gt;</i>/&lt;<i>IMAGE&gt;</i></li>
  <li>for a transfer starting from the local workspace &lt;WS&gt; and without
    image, the path to the data directory is<br>
    <i>&lt;path specified by the -lwd option&gt;</i>/MultiSite/&lt;<i>WS&gt;</i>/_NO_IMAGE_</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to use a specific directory for gathering information for
all transfers of a site because this can facilitate the management of transfers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is easier to monitor the amount of data taken by transfer files when
    they are located on the same file system</li>
  <li>it is easier to manage several transfers if all information are gathered
    under the same directory rather than scattered over transfer workspaces'
    images.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Data sub-directory"></a>Transfer Specific Sub-directory</h4>

<p>Information are not found directly under the &quot;data directory&quot; but
under sub-directories whose names are computed regarding the adl_site_transfer
starting parameters. These sub-directories allow to use the same location for
storing information for different transfers. Even when the local workspace is
the origin of several different transfers, it is possible to use its image for
storing information.</p>

<p>The name of a sub-directory is the
concatenation of the following strings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>local workspace tree name (see -ltree option)</li>
    <li>local workspace name (see -lw option)</li>
    <li>remote site name (see -rsite option)</li>
    <li>remote workspace name (see -rw option)</li>
    <li>remote workspace tree name (see -rtree option)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Understanding a transfer"></a>Understanding a Transfer</h3>

<p>This section describes the different steps composing a transfer between
workspaces. The adl_site_transfer command prints a message at the beginning of
each step and all traces are available through a html report that can be found
under the following path:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;<a href="#Data Directory">path to the data directory</a>&gt;/&lt;<a href="#Data sub-directory">transfer
  specific directory</a>&gt;/follow_up.htm</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A transfer falls down in several main steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Initialisation of local and remote environments: adl_site_transfer checks
    that the remote SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager is reachable and that the
    local and remote workspaces exist.</li>
  <li>Local and remote environment analysis: the command checks that the two SCM
    installations share the same data exchange formats (SCM data and source
    files) and looks for the availability of <a href="#Packaging and Compressing Files Using External Tools"> tar and compression
    tools</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="#ADL_TAR_DIR"> ADL_TAR_DIR</a> environment variable is checked in both local and
        remote environments to know whether a &quot;tar&quot; tool is available.</li>
      <li>The &quot;gzip&quot; tool is searched in both local and remote
        environments to known whether data can be compressed before their
        sending.<br>
        Note that those tools are not brought with SCM but can be used as soon
        as they are available in both environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Previous transfer's recovery.<br>
    The program goes through this step only if the previous transfer failed
    while importing data from one site to the other one. In that case the
    previous transfer is finished before starting the new one.</li>
  <li>Importing changes from remote site.<br>
    This step consists in computing what changed in remote workspace since the
    last transfer and getting those changes into the local workspace.</li>
  <li>Solving conflicting changes.<br>
    These conflicts happen because the local workspace contains some changes
    that are conflicting with some of those coming from the distant site. Like
    the adl_sync command, the adl_site_transfer command calls the
    adl_solve_merge command [1] in order to solve all conflicting changes.</li>
  <li>Exporting changes to remote site.<br>
    This steps is the reverse step of the fourth one but is started only if
    there is no more merge to be solved in the local workspace.</li>

              this step</li>
            <li>the colour of a cell gives its status: green for OK, grey if not
              executed or useless, yellow if it is under way and red if it
              failed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The global status of the transfer is given at the top of the page
          and using the same colour as for the cells.</li>

          running transfer can be followed by using the current browser
          &quot;refresh&quot; button or using the one given at the top of the

<h3><a name="Packaging and Compressing Files Using External Tools"></a>Packaging
and Compressing Files Using External Tools</h3>
<h4>Compression</h4>
<p>On Unix platform</p>
<p>The command looks first for the &quot;gzip&quot; program and, if not found,
it looks for the &quot;compress&quot; program. If one program is found and is
available on both sites, it will be used for compressing files. Note however
that if the SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager is running on Windows-NT platform,
the &quot;compress&quot; program will never be chosen whatever the local
platform is.</p>
<p>On Windows-NT platform</p>
<p>The command looks for the &quot;gzip&quot; program and if it is available on
both sites, it will be used for compressing files.</p>
<h4><a name="ADL_TAR_DIR"></a>Packaging</h4>
<p>The command looks for the environment variable ADL_TAR_DIR and its value must
be the path to a directory where a &quot;adl_tar&quot; program must be found.
This variable must be set also in the working environment of the SCM Multi-site
Transfer Manager, it can point to a different path than on the local host but
must also contain a &quot;adl_tar&quot; program.</p>
<p>If the &quot;adl_tar&quot; program is found on both sites, it will be used
for packaging user files and transfer specific files before sending them from
one site to the other. Note that those 'tar' files will be also compressed if a
compression tool is available on both sites.</p>
<h4>adl_tar's interface</h4>
<p>Here are the parameters of each call to the adl_tar program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when creating a tar
    <ul>
      <li>-cvf &lt;filename&gt;<br>
        &lt;filename&gt; is the path to the 'tar' file</li>
      <li>-T &lt;filename&gt;<br>
        &lt;filename&gt; is the path to a file containing the list of files to
        be copied in the 'tar' file</li>
      <li>&lt;nothing&gt; or -z or -Z<br>
        -z means that a compression is expected using the &quot;gzip&quot;

<p><b><sup>(*)</sup> </b>Normally these options are not very useful since a
filter is already active by attaching or detaching frameworks in both local and
remote workspaces. They can serve punctually to transfer changes concerning a
subset of frameworks.<br>
 If framework names are given and if the option -export_only is specified, the frameworks are found in the local workspace.
Otherwise the frameworks are found in the remote workspace.</p>

<p>Start a transfer between local workspace &quot;localws&quot; and remote
workspace &quot;remotews&quot; and let adl_site_transfer uses the default image
for both workspaces. The SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager is running on host
&quot;lebadsy&quot; and is listening on port 23452, &quot;/tmp&quot; is chosen
as the remote temporary directory since &quot;lebadsy&quot; is a UNIX
workstation. The transfer is performed between the local tree &quot;V5R8&quot;
and the remote tree &quot;V5R8&quot;. The -l_sync and -l_promote options are
used to respectively synchronize the remote workspace before computing changes
and promoting its contents after importing in it what changed on local
workspace.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Start a transfer between local workspace &quot;localws&quot; and remote
workspace &quot;remotews&quot; and do not use any image for both workspaces. The
SCM Multi-site Transfer Manager is running on host &quot;lebadsy&quot; and is
listening on port 23452, &quot;/tmp&quot; is chosen as the remote temporary
directory since &quot;lebadsy&quot; is a UNIX workstation. The transfer is
performed between the local tree &quot;V5R8&quot; and the remote tree
&quot;V5R8&quot;. As no image is used, a data directory is specified using the -lwd
option.</p>

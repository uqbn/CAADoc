     <p>The Changes Graphic Tool is a tool that displays the history of all 
     changes applied on a given object. This allows to understand the evolution 
     of the object by seeing the origin of each change (previous change, origin

 <h3><a name="Principles"></a>Principles</h3>
 <p>Conversely to the adl_ds_chg command [<a href="#Ref1">1</a>] whose purpose 
 is to display information about one object currently visible in a given 
 workspace, the Changes History Graphic Tool is a tool that gives <u>a general 
 view on all changes</u> that happened on one object since its creation. Like 
 managed internally, the history of the five types of changes appears as five 
 oriented graphs where nodes are change versions and arrows give the origin of 
 each version.</p>
 <p>As the five types of changes are managed separately by SCM, the 
 corresponding graphs are displayed in separate panes.</p>
 <p>
 <img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/hand.gif" width="31" height="15"> 
 Remember that the tool displays information about the origin of each version, 
 not about those currently visible in users' workspaces.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <h3><a name="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3>
 <p>The interface is split in two parts: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>one part for displaying the change graphs, one graph per pane.</li>
   <li>and a second part for information about versions</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The icon bar contains&nbsp;</p>
 <ul>
   <li>the icon
   <img border="0" src="images/ADLSFind.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"> 
   for changing the software object whose history is displayed;</li>
   <li>the name that has been typed for specifying the software object,&nbsp;<br>
   followed by the name used when creating the object in SCM (it can be 
   different if renamed since its creation).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Each graph is composed of&nbsp;</p>
 <ul>
   <li>nodes: they correspond to the different changes that have been applied on 
   the object, the icon used for each node represents the type of change 
   associated with this version</li>
 </ul>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLContentIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> for 
 changes of type file content,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <u>Warning</u>: when the file content of a change is not accessible, the 
 following icon is used :
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLContentNotAvailIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> 
 and the Open, Project, Compare actions are disabled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLMoveIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> for 
 changes of type move,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLCreationIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> for 
 changes of type delete,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLExecIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> for 
 changes of type change of executable rights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="images/ADLDescrIcon.gif" width="32" height="32"> for 
 changes of type description.</p>
 <ul>
   <li>arrows: they show the order of versions, i.e. the node from which an 
   arrow starts is the version that existed before the one pointed by the arrow 
   was created.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
 Warning</u>: in the graph of changes of contents, some of the arrows going to a 
 node can be in grey (like the exemple below).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 This means that the file content of this node is the same that the change 
 linked to it with the orange arrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 In the exemple below, the file content of version 3.Dev1T1DOC is the same as 
 the one of version 2.PrjT1DOC, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 so the link between 3.DevT1DOC and 2.DevT1DOC is not pertinent.</p>

 <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
 <h5><a name="What Is The Best Way To Specify the Object We Want"></a>What Is 
 The Best Way To Specify the Object We Want?</h5>
 <p>The usual way is to enter the &quot;user&quot; name of the file or directory you want 
 to retrieve. Then if you think that there is a good chance that there is only 
 one file having this name whatever its location is inside a workspace image 
 file tree, you can unselect the check box &quot;Path from root&quot;. Conversely if you 
 guess that a lot of files exist with this name (for instance &quot;IdentityCard.h&quot; 
 or &quot;Imakefile.mk&quot;) it should be better to give a path from the workspace image 
 root directory. (See &quot;<a href="#Multiple Objects Having the Same Name">Multiple 
 Objects Having the Same Name</a>&quot; to know what happen in such a case).</p>
 <p>Entering an object identifier is not an usual way to access it. Nevertheless 
 it is interesting to be able to enter it instead of a file name in case another 
 command gave it and we want to know to which object it corresponds.</p>
 <p>Like for the object identifier, it is interesting to enter a change 
 identifier in case another tool gave it, otherwise it is easier to manipulate 
 file names. Note however that entering a change identifier will lead to select 
 automatically the corresponding node in the corresponding graph.</p>
 <h5><a name="What is an Object Identifier"></a>What Is an Object Identifier?</h5>
 <p>All the objects managed by SCM have a unique identifier which is computed 
 when they are created. This identifier is used internally by SCM commands 
 because the user name is just an attribute that is not unique and that can be 
 changed at any time. This is not the case for a SCM identifier which is unique 
 and does never change.</p>
 <p>Some SCM commands can print this identifier. For instance the adl_ds_chg [<a href="#Ref1">1</a>] 
 command gives it at the beginning of output.</p>

 <p>Any change applied on an object is registered by SCM in association with an 
 unique identifier. It is the same kind of identifier as for an object.</p>

 <p>When the tool is started and a file (or an object identifier) is entered, 
 the program displays information about files that are currently checked-out in 
 workspaces. This information is given because a check-out operation does not 
 create any new version; a new version will be created for the new file contents 
 during the check-in operation (see adl_ci [<a href="#Ref6">6</a>]). This 
 feature is available also when changing the object whose version graphs are 
 currently displayed.</p>
 <p>As these information disappear from the information pane as soon as a 
 version is selected, it is possible to display by using the menu bar or the 
 contextual menu out of a node (selecting the item &quot;Show checkouts&quot;).</p>

 <h3><a name="Multiple Objects Having the Same Name"></a>Multiple Objects Having 
 the Same Name</h3>
 <p>This case does not occur when using an object identifier because it is 
 unique.</p>
 <p>Otherwise it is possible to enter a file name (short name or path name) that 
 may correspond to different SCM objects because</p>
 <ul>
   <li>they have the same name but not the same location (for instance one 'IdentityCard.h' 
   file exists in all frameworks).</li>
   <li>they have been created under different names but were renamed to the 
   given name at a given time</li>
   <li>they had the same location but not at the same time</li>
   <li>some have existed but are deleted now and new objects have been created 
   since their deletion</li>
   <li>etc</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 <img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/hand.gif" width="31" height="15"> 
 What is important to know is that the research is done on all objects that have 
 had the given name at a given time and not the first or last name of them.</p>
 <p>When several objects are found for the same name, the program displays the 
 list in order to let the user aware of that and to let him/her to decide which 
 one is to be used for retrieving changes.</p>

 <p>Information displayed in the list should help the user to decide which

   <li>the creation date</li>
   <li>the name of the site where the object was created&nbsp;<br>
   (If you don't share frameworks between multiple sites, the site name will be 
   always the same)</li>
   <li>the path of the file if the objet is seen in the current workspace (the 
   workspace that was current in the window from where the graphical tool has 
   been launched)</li>

     has been forgotten (see adl_forget_chg [<a href="#Ref7">7</a>]) and a new 
     check-out have been performed afterwards, creating the version 6.2.dev1.</p>

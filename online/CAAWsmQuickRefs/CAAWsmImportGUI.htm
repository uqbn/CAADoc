<h3><a name="Principles"></a>Principles</h3>
<p>The Import Graphic Tool can be used instead of the adl_import command for
importing changes from one workspace into the current one. The main difference
between the two commands is that adl_import operates on objects specified by the
user while the Import Graphic Tool shows all the object changes which appeared
since a given date and let the user to choose what are those he/she wants to
import.</p>
<p>Then the&nbsp; main interest is that the user is not obliged to remember all
the changes performed in one workspace before importing them into another
workspace. Using the Import Graphic Tool, he/she can see all the changes from
the last to the oldest ones by just specifying the date since which all the
object changes must be retrieved from the database.</p>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" alt="information.gif (174 bytes)" width="31" height="30">
Note that when the same change has been applied several times on the same
object, only the last change is displayed because it is not possible to extract
one change among all to import it.</p>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" alt="information.gif (174 bytes)" width="31" height="30">
Note also that the changes displayed are not only those performed locally in the
workspace where they are found: the tool displays all the changes which arrived,
in the attached components, in the workspace whatever they have been performed
locally or have come by collect, synchronization or import.<br>
It's up to the user to choose what are the changes he/she is responsible of and
to import them.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3>
<p>The interface is split in two parts:
<ul>
  <li>one part for displaying the object changes in a tree format and for
    selecting/unselecting changes before starting the import</li>
  <li>and a second part for information and printing traces of command
    executions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The title bar displays the names of the origin and target workspace for the
import.</p>
<p>Under the menu bar, the date which is displayed is the date used for
searching the object changes, that's to say the date since which all the changes
perfomed on objects present in the origin workspace have been searched and then
displayed by the tool.</p>

<h3><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h3>
<h4><a name="Starting the Tool"></a><strong>Starting the Tool</strong></h4>
<p>To launch this tool, you have first to launch the federate graphic tool by
the command adl_gui. For more informations, have a look for its <a href="CAAWsmADLGUI.htm">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>A current working workspace is needed to use this tool. The current workspace
is considered as the target workspace for the import.</p>
<p>This origin workspace has to be specified in the first panel opened by the
Tool. The tool will retrieve changes from this workspace since a date which will
be asked by the tool.</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/ImportGUI4.gif" alt="ImportGUI4.gif (14073 bytes)" width="480" height="270"></td>
    <td valign="top">When the tool is started, it asks the user for entering the
      selection date.
      <p>If the tool is used several times between the same origin workspace and
      running in the same target workspace's image, the tool will propose the
      date of the last import launched from it and between the same origin and
      target workspaces. Note that a current working image is needed because the
      date is recorded in it.</p>
      <p>In other cases, the date proposed is the current date, it must be
      changed in order to select the object changes to be displayed. Note that
      the current date will not select any change since nothing should have been
      done at the &quot;same&quot; time in the origin workspace!</p>
      <p>The date must be entered in the format
      <ul>
        <li>YYYY/MM/DD</li>
        <li>YYYY/MM/DD-hh:mm</li>
        <li>YYYY/MM/DD-hh:mm:ss</li>
      </ul>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/ImportGUI5.gif" alt="ImportGUI5.gif (10772 bytes)" width="360" height="180"></td>
    <td valign="top">The &quot;Calendar&quot; button allows to enter a date,
      starting from the date currently entered in the first dialog window and
      linked with a calendar, that's to say that if you change one date's field,
      the others are computed accordingly.
      <p>When a new date is set, click on the &quot;OK&quot; button and this
      date will be set also for the first dialog window.</td>

<h4><a name="Changing the Selection Date"></a><strong>Changing the Selection
Date</strong></h4>
<p>This can be done by clicking on the button displaying the current selected
date. Each time a new date is entered, the display is refreshed with the new set
of object changes.</p>
<p>Normally any date could be entered:
<ul>
  <li>if the date is older than the creation date of the origin workspace, all
    changes will be displayed</li>
  <li>if the date is younger than the most recent change, no change will be
    displayed</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway remember that the same changes can be imported several times, only the
first import will be significant, further ones won't produce anything. So it is
not dangerous to select a date which lead to select too old changes.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4><a name="Comparing Files"></a><strong>Comparing Files</strong></h4>
<p>When a change on the contents of a file is displayed by the tool, the
associated popup menu contains an item allowing to launch a &quot;diff&quot;
tool between the two files.
<p>The default &quot;diff&quot; tool is&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>vdiff32 on Windows-NT</li>
  <li>xdiff on Unix</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to change the default &quot;diff&quot; tool by opening the
settings window: open the &quot;Tool&quot; menu and select the
&quot;Settings&quot; item.&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/ImportGUISettings.jpg" width="486" height="301"></td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">The &quot;OK&quot; button validates and saves
      the changes. The new values will be taken into account between sessions
      until they are changed again. Those settings are specific to the current
      user and the current platform.
      <p>The &quot;Cancel&quot; button is used to cancel any change performed in
      the window and to close it.</p>
      <p>The &quot;Defaults&quot; button is used to cancel any change and to go
      back to the initial values. The window remains opened.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The comparison is performed using the file contents that are registered in
the SCM database and not those present in the workspaces' images. Therefore,
when the workspaces' images are not refreshed, it is possible that the file
contents that are displayed by the 'diff' tool are not those that can be found
in the workspace's images.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4><a name="Selecting Object Changes To Import"></a><strong>Selecting Object
Changes To Import</strong></h4>
<p>By default, when the object changes are searched and then displayed, all of
them are selected. If you don't want to import all the changes you can unselect
some of them either
<ul>
  <li>by clicking on the check box to the left of the change</li>
  <li>or by opening the associated popup menu and selecting the item
    &quot;Unselect for import&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the select/unselect mechanism is recursive on the embedding nodes.
For example, if you unselect a framework node, then all the changes concerning
internal modules, directories or files will be unselected too.</p>

      This icon indicates that the creation of the framework is to be imported.
      In addition, when you click on the framework using the left button of the
      mouse information are displayed in the information pane: in the picture to
      the left, you can see that no target tree is specified yet.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Click on the framework using the right button of the mouse to open the
associated popup menu and select the item &quot;Select destination tree&quot;.
Once the tree entered, it will be displayed in the information pane.</p>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" alt="information.gif (174 bytes)" width="31" height="30">
Note that the need to specify a target tree is not related to the fact that the
frameworks in concern are already present in the target workspace or not. The
Import Graphic Tool just shows the changes that appeared in the origin
workspace, not what is missing in the target workspace. Therefore it is possible
that the framework creations are shown because the origin date given to the tool
is too old</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4><a name="Running A Simulation"></a><strong>Running A Simulation</strong></h4>
<p>It is possible to run one import on the selected object changes and to see
what should occur in a real import by looking at the resulting traces.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of such a simulation:</p>

<h4><a name="Directory for Simulation"></a><strong>Directory for Simulation</strong></h4>
<p>It is possible to specify a directory when running a simulation. In this
case, the imported files will be projected in this directory.</p>
<p>To specify a directory, select the &quot;Simulation directory...&quot; item
in the &quot;Import&quot; menu.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h3><a name="Sample"></a>Samples</h3>
<h4><a name="Importing Fixes"></a><strong>Importing Fixes</strong></h4>
<p>The scenario is to import in a workspace what has been done in another
workspace since its last promotion. This is a situation that can take place
between two development workspaces or between a maintenance and a development
workspace.</p>
<p>We can distinguish two cases: a first one where it is the first time the
Import Graphic Tool is used and a second one where the tool is often used
between the same workspaces.</p>
<p>First case
<ol>
  <li>In the first workspace the user fixes a bug or writes a new functionality
    and possibly promotes his/her changes to the parent workspace</li>
  <li>Then this user decides to import all the changes he/she made in the second
    workspace. The question is then to choose an appropriate date for selecting
    all the changes (because it could have taken a long time for doing them).</li>
  <li>The answer can be to run the adl_ls_promo [<a href="#Ref1">1</a>] command
    on the origin workspace to know the date of the previous promotion(*) since
    all the changes have a modification date more recent than this promotion
    date</li>
  <li>Entering this promotion date&nbsp;in the Import Graphic Tool will display
    all changes to import in the target workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" alt="information.gif (174 bytes)" width="31" height="30">
(*) a multi-tree workspace can be promoted in a subset of the trees where it
exists. In addition, a promotion request is registered only if there is
something to promote from the workspace. That's why we can have different
workspace revisions in each tree for a multi-tree workspace and that's why the
users must choose themselves the appropriate date by looking at the result in
each tree of the adl_ls_promo command.</p>
<p>Second case
<ol>
  <li>The user always uses the same target workspace's image when importing
    modifications</li>
  <li>Each time an import is launched from the tool, the date of this import is
    recorded in this target workspace's image</li>
  <li>Each time the tool is started, the default date is the date of the last
    import, so it should be kept as the date since which all modifications
    should be retrieved (**)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/caution.gif" alt="caution.gif (174 bytes)" width="32" height="32">
(**) Note that we assume here that all modifications have been selected in the
previous imports because those modifications won't be proposed using the default
date.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4><a name="Creating A New Workspace"></a>Creating A New Workspace</h4>
<p>This is the case where a workspace has been used for a while for developing
new functionalities but those functionnalities cannot be delivered in the
workspace tree where this workspace exists - for instance because the tree
turned in maintenance mode and a new tree has been created to receive
developments for the next product releases.</p>
<p>As it is not possible to move a workspace between workspace trees, the
solution could be to import all the changes made in this workspace in a new
workspace created in the new workspace tree. If the first workspace was
dedicated to those developments, we can choose its creation date as the date
since which all changes must be transferred by the Import Graphic Tool. To know
this date, run the adl_ls_ws_rev [<a href="#Ref2">2</a>] command and looks at
the first revision.</p>

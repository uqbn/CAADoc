      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This paper presents the general topological concepts that are supported by CATIA V5.</p>
      <p>After defining the topology, the basic entities (cell, domain, body) are precisely 
      described. Then, non-manifold topologies are introduced and illustrated. A summarized chart 
      allows the reader to visualize the links between those different concepts. </p>

<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Topology for Geometric Design</h3>
<p>Topology allows to represent objects, by detailing their boundaries and the connections between 
their different parts. This figure shows an example of the topological description of a simple shell 
object.</p>

      <td>
      <ul>
         <li>
         The shell object is made of one topological 2D entity called a face (F).</li>
         <li>
         The face F is the limitation of the surface S by four connected 1D boundaries called edges 
         (E1, E2, E3, E4).</li>
         <li>
         Each edge (E1, for example) is a limitation of a geometric curve (C), lying on the surface. 
         It is bounded by two vertices (V1, V2).</li>
         <li>
         The edges are connected by their vertices to bound the face.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>

<p>&quot;Regular&quot; objects are called manifold. Objects presenting &quot;hairs&quot; or &quot;scales&quot;, are called 
non-manifold. The use of non manifold topology is very useful to simplify the representation of 
objects: in an early stage of design, a thin stiffener of a solid object may be represented as a 2D 
element (&quot;scale&quot;).</p>

      object V: this is a non-manifold configuration.
      <p>The object B without the face F is manifold.</td>

<p>See <a href="#Manifold">The Manifold and Non Manifold Concepts</a> for a detailed presentation of 
these concepts.</p>
<p>CGM uses the technology called &quot;cell complexes&quot; (see the paper of Rossignac for instance), which 
allows to: </p>
<ul>
   <li>
   Handle multidimensional concepts in an unified way</li>
   <li>

<h3><a name="Objects"></a>Basic Topological Objects</h3>
<p>The topology manages three types of entities: </p>
<ul>
   <li>
   The cell: most basic topological entity.</li>
   <li>
   The domain: set of connected cells grouped to define boundaries.</li>
   <li>
   The body: the &quot;concrete&quot; object to modelize.</li>
</ul>
<p>We detail here these entities.</p>

<h4><a name="Cell"></a>Cell</h4>
<p>A <i>cell</i> is a connected limitation of an underlying geometry.</p>
<p>There are four types of cells according to the dimension of the space in which they lie.</p>

<p>Cells of upper dimensions are bounded by cells of lower dimensions: a volume is the limitation of 
the 3D space by faces, a face is the limitation of a surface by edges and an edge is the limitation 
of a curve by vertices.</p>

<h4><a name="Domain"></a>Domain</h4>
<p>A <i>domain</i> is a set of cells of dimension n connected by cells of dimension n-1. A domain 
can possibly contain only one cell.</p>
<p>Domains are useful to manipulate altogether the boundaries of a cell of upper dimension. If a 
face, for instance, is bounded by four connected edges, all those edges are conveniently grouped 
into a domain. Like cells, domains bear specific names according to what they actually contain.</p>

<p>Lumps, shells, wires and vertices in volume are boundaries of 3D entities. Loops and vertices in 
faces are boundaries of 2D entities. No domain is associated to the boundaries of edges (1D 
entities): vertices directly bounds edges, because such domain does not bring any added value to the 
model.</p>

<table>

         <li>
         A wire is a set of edges connected by vertices in the 3D space</li>
         <li>
         A vertex in face is immersed into the face. In the case of the figure, it represents the 
         connection between the face F and the cone C: this is a non manifold configuration.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>Domains can define outer, inner, or immersed frontiers: vertex in face or vertex in volume are 
typical immersed boundaries. Notice that loops (resp. shell) can also be immersed into a face (resp. 
volume), but this type of domain is always called a loop (resp. shell) and not a &quot;edge in face&quot; 
(resp. &quot;face in volume&quot;).</p>
<p>Reading the different definitions of the domains, you can see that two faces (resp. two volumes) 
cannot be connected only by a vertex (resp. by an edge or a vertex). In this case, it will be 
necessary to have two shells (resp. two lumps). Domains define manifold components inside 
non-manifold objects.</p>

<h4><a name="Body"></a>Body</h4>
<p>A <i>body</i> is a set of domains non necessarily connected (with non common boundary of any 
dimension). Bodies must satisfy the following properties: </p>
<ol>
   <li>
   Any cell bounding a cell in a body also belongs to the body.</li>
   <li>
   The intersection of the underlying geometry for any two cells in a body is also the underlying 
   geometry for a cell ( and this cell must belong to the body, following the property 1). In other 
   words, &quot;no intersection of the underlying geometries without having a cell representing the 
   intersection&quot;.</li>
</ol>

      If faces F1 and F2 (lying on surfaces F1 and F2 respectively) are cells of the body B, then 
      the edge E, lying on the intersection of S1 and S2, has to exist and is also a cell of B.</td>

<p>The body only references domains, even if there is only one cell in the domain. See the example

domain.</p>

<h3><a name="Manifold"></a>The Manifold and Non Manifold Concepts</h3>
<h4><a name="Definition"></a>Definition</h4>
<p>CGM allows you to create and use manifold and non-manifold bodies. Mathematically speaking, a 
N-manifold object is a set of points which neighborhood is represented by a N-dimensional bowl. Take 
a lump domain (resp. shell, loop). If for each point of this domain, there exists a neighborhood of 
the domain equivalent to <em>only one</em> piece of a sphere (resp. disk, segment), the lump (resp. 
shell, loop) is 3D (resp. 2D, 1D ) -manifold. Otherwise, it is non manifold.</p>
<p>The following figures shows examples of manifold and non manifold objects. The place where there 
are non manifold are highlighted. The bodies can be: </p>
<ul>
   <li>
   singular: if there exists cells of dimension n that are only connected by cells of dimension n-2. 
   (B4, B5, C4, C5)</li>
   <li>
   heterogeneous: mixing of domains of different dimensions in the same body (C6).</li>
   <li>
   general: cells of dimension n with more than 2 connections with other cells of same dimension 
   (A2, B6)</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-manifold topology offers several benefits: </p>
<ul>
   <li>
   Allows the simplified representation of parts: a very slight slot inside an object can be 
   represented as a face immersed into a volume in an early stage of design, a stiffener can be 
   modelized as a face,...</li>
   <li>
   Allows topological operations to always return a solution. Even if the final result is manifold, 
   intermediate steps can be non manifold. A topological operation on manifold bodies may return 
   non-manifold configurations: let be a cube. Let now be a cylinder which is tangent to the cube 
   and inside it. These two objects are manifold. Operate now the union of the cube and the 
   cylinder: the resulting body is non manifold. Split now by a plane: the final result is manifold, 
   although an intermediate body is not. This scenario is illustrated by the following figure:</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Dividing"></a>Dividing a body into domains</h4>
<p>When a body contains non connected cells, or non-manifold configurations, it will be necessary to 
divide it into several manifold domains. The following steps insure the unique decomposition of a

<h3 align="left"><a name="InShort"></a>Restrictions Regarding Non-Manifold Bodies</h3>
<p align="left">Most operations can be performed on non-manifold bodies, but not all.&nbsp; The 
trend is to allow the user to check whether he accepts to generate a non-manifold result.&nbsp; For 
example, you won't be able to extrude or fill&nbsp; a profile which has a closed portion but 
exhibits a free edge and unless you uncheck the &quot;Manifold&quot; check box, you won't be able to join a 
non-manifold body to another body.</p>
<p align="left">If you try to manipulate non-manifold bodies by using a CATIA interactive command, 
you will get a message warning you that the body is non-manifold. Usually, you won't be able to 
complete the intended operation unless you make your initial body manifold. CATIA dialogs allow you 
to remove sub-elements in order to obtain appropriate manifold bodies. But the operation which 
consists in removing sub-elements can only be applied to manifold domains. If your body is not made 
up of correct manifold domains, you won't be able to clean or transform your initial body. This is 
why <a href="#Dividing">&quot;Dividing a Body into Domains&quot;</a> is of importance. </p>
<p align="left">Note that CGM services allow you to create non-manifold bodies while usually the 
CATIA workbenches will &quot;break&quot; the created bodies into appropriate domains. That way, the resulting 
bodies are non-manifold-like but contain sub-elements easy to be manipulated. The examples below 
illustrate this strategy.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Example 1: Using a NON-MANIFOLD Body in a Join Operation</i></b></p>
<div align="left">

   <table border="0" cellspacing="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber2" width="905">
      <tr>
         <td valign="top" width="501">Create a three-edge body (see figure on the right-hand side) 
         by assembling three concurrent wires (use CATTopWire then CATHybAssemble). This body is 
         made up of <b>four vertices and three edges</b>. It is clearly non-manifold. You can check 
         this by using the CATBody::GetCellsHighestDimension method.<p>If you try to join the 
         highlighted body (a line) with the three-edge body by using the Join interactive command, 
         you will get the message:</p>
         <p align="center">&nbsp; &quot;Update error: Non Manifold Body&quot;.</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td valign="top" width="501">Now, if you try to remove the edge that makes the resulting 
         body non-manifold (use the &quot;Sub-Elements to Remove&quot; tab in the &quot;Join Definition&quot; dialog 
         box), you will get the message:<p align="center">&nbsp;&quot;Bad topology&quot;. </p>
         <p>This message tells you that the sub-element to be deleted is not <i><b>fully</b></i> 
         contained into a domain. Actually, it shares a vertex with two other wires.&nbsp; You 
         cannot go further in your operation, you must rebuild the initial body to make it manifold 
         or divide it into manifold domains as indicated <a href="#Dividing">above</a>. In this 
         case, the best would consist in dividing the body into three single-edge wires not sharing 
         any vertices. </td>

         remove unappropriate elements will be made easier. The Sketcher sticks to this strategy.

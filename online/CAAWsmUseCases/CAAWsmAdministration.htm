 <h3><a name="global architecture"></a>Global Architecture</h3>
 <p>The SCM product supports a client/server architecture. Two types of hosts 
 are involved in the execution of a SCM command: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>The client machine: any command is executed locally on the user's host 
   and connects to the SCM server host(s) to retrieve information</li>
   <li>The server machine: at least one machine is dedicated for managing SCM 
   repositories and where SCM daemons are running.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>When a command is running, it is connected with several daemons running on 
 one or several distant hosts (SCM servers).</p>
 <table width="100%">

       <li>The &quot;File Contents Server&quot; process manages its own repository.</li>
       <li>The &quot;Monitor&quot; process manages data in SCM database.</li>
       <li>Data for configuration management are stored in database.<br>
       The same database can be shared with the &quot;Monitor&quot; process.</li>
     </ul>
     </td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <p>The global architecture can be more complex depending on the size of 
 software projects and the number of people involved in. It is possible to have 
 several machines on which several File Servers and SCM databases processes have 
 been installed. Whatever the number of databases or File Servers is, the way 
 commands work is the same, the complexity is often just seen by the SCM 
 administrator (the end user is not aware of it).</p>

 <h4><a name="Databases"></a>Databases</h4>
 <p>There are two kinds of databases managed by SCM: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>SCM databases</li>
   <li>File Server databases.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>A SCM database is used for storing any data that are not source files. It is
 <a href="#Oracle Database">created</a> by the Oracle or DB2 administrator and 
 is known by SCM commands using its SID (SID = System Identifier = a unique name 
 for an Oracle database instance). One or more databases can be used depending 
 on the amount of data and the number of users to manage.</p>
 <p><a name="Central database"></a>Multiple databases can be used for storing 
 either: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Monitor process' data<br>
   There is only one database of this type, known as the<strong> monitor 
   database</strong></li>
   <li>Site information (1 database )<br>
   There is only one database of this type, known as the <strong>central 
   database</strong></li>
   <li>Configuration management specific data<br>
   There can be several databases of this type, known as <strong>departmental 
   databases</strong></li>
 </ul>
 <p>The File Server database is a repository managed by a FileServer and whose 
 purpose is to store any user file. This kind of database is
 <a href="#File Server Database">initialized</a> by the SCM administrator using 
 the File Server program.</p>
 <p>Depending on the number of servers available and their characteristics, it 
 is possible to install on a same host one SCM database and one File Server but 
 having several File Servers or several SCM databases on a same host is not 
 interesting.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h4><a name="Trees"></a>Trees</h4>
 <p>(Workspace) Trees are the first &quot;objects&quot; to be created when starting with 
 SCM. A tree is created by specifying: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>A name</li>
   <li>A database name<br>
   It will contain Configuration Management data related to objects managed in 
   workspaces belonging to this workspace tree</li>
   <li>A host name and a port number identifying a File Server<br>
   It will manage all source files for workspaces belonging to this workspace 
   tree</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Any combination of File Servers and databases is possible. The following 
 figures show how several trees can be managed. One important thing to know is 
 that multiple databases or File Servers should be installed on different hosts, 
 providing better performance.</p>

     very big, it could be interesting to use different File Servers for 
     managing source files associated with different workspace trees. Of course, 
     those File Servers should run on different hosts (for performance reasons).
     <p>It is also possible to install a new File Server (on a new host) for 
     managing source files for new trees if the host(s) where the other File 
     Server(s) run is (are) heavily loaded or if there is not enough disk space

     own SCM server with one SCM database and one File Server. This architecture 
     does not forbid the use of multi-tree workspaces for working in all 
     databases at the same time (for instance for gathering developments at 
     entreprise level).</td>

 <h3><a name="Accessing Administratives Commands"></a>Accessing Administrative 
 Commands</h3>
 <p>Commands are available in search path after executing the tck_profile 
 command with an appropriate TCK. Two TCKs are generated when installing a 
 CD-ROM [<a href="#References">1</a>]: one for all users and one for the SCM 
 administrators only. This second TCK gives access to administrative commands 
 like: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>adl_lock_base, adl_unlock_base</li>
   <li>adl_ls_contents_server, adl_mk_contents_server</li>
   <li>adl_mk_tree, adl_ren_tree, adl_rm_tree, adl_set_tree</li>
   <li>adl_mk_root_ws</li>
   <li>adl_monitor, adl_mo_admin</li>
   <li>adl_file_server, adl_fs_admin</li>
   <li>adl_upgrade_db</li>
 </ul>
 <p>For instance, after having downloaded a CAA V5 Tools CD-ROM under the path &quot;<em>C:\Program 
 Files\Dassault Systemes\T04D28</em>&quot;, execute the tck_profile command and list 
 the available TCKs:</p>

 <h3><a name="Creating Databases"></a>Creating Databases</h3>
 <p>Before creating databases, people must have checked </p>
 <ul>
   <li>how many organizations are going to use the Workspace Manager</li>
   <li>how many people will be involved in development projects</li>
   <li>what is the target hardware for installing SCM and File Server databases</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Thinking about these topics should lead to choose a global architecture from 
 the ones described in <a href="#Trees">Trees</a> section.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h4><a name="How many databases are needed?"></a>How Many Databases Are Needed?</h4>
 <p>We advise to start with a single SCM database and a single File Server 
 database. It is not needed to set up several databases at the beginning except 
 if SCM is intended to be used by hundreds of developers. Depending on the 
 number of SCM users the SCM database is created with different characteristics 
 (initial size of tablespaces, size of extents, etc). Three types of database 
 can be set up: small, medium and large: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>small database: for managing a small organization (up to 20 developers) 
   and 2 or 3 workspaces per user. The number of files should be under 5000 
   files.</li>
   <li>medium database: for managing between 50 and 100 developers and up to 
   20000 files.</li>
   <li>large database : for bigger organizations or for managing lot of files.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><em>Is it possible to add new databases for supporting new teams?</em></p>
 <p>Yes it is possible. The method would be to let the first created database as 
 the <a href="#Central database">monitor database</a> and let the new databases 
 be the departemental databases, that is to say by creating new trees in the new 
 databases.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h4><a name="Oracle Database"></a>SCM Databases</h4>
 <p>The SCM initialization is performed once an empty database (or instance) has 
 been created. Please refer to the Oracle or DB2 documentation for this task.</p>
 <p>To complete the initialization, you must connect to the new database as 
 administrator (DBA) and perform the following tasks: </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Create the SCM account and possibly the associated profile<br>
   This account will be used both in step 2 and when installing a new SCM 
   version that needs to upgrade existing databases</li>
   <li>Create the SCM tables.<br>
   There are three kind of tables to be created depending on the futur use of 
   the database being initialized:
   <ol>
     <li>Tables for the &quot;Monitor&quot; process</li>
     <li>Tables for site information</li>
     <li>Tables for configuration management data (trees, workspaces, 
     components, etc)</li>
   </ol>
   </li>
 </ol>
 <p>The three kinds of tables can be created in a single database as well as in 
 different databases but </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Tables for the &quot;Monitor&quot; process should be created in only one database</li>
   <li>Tables for site information should be created in only one database (often 
   the same as the one used by the Monitor).<br>
   This database is known as the <strong>c</strong>entral <strong>d</strong>ata<strong>b</strong>ase 
   (cdb).</li>
   <li>Tables for configuration management data are created in each database 
   whose purpose is to store workspace <a href="#Trees">trees</a>.<br>
   Such databases are known as <strong>dep</strong>ar<strong>t</strong>mental 
   databases (dept)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The creation tasks are performed by SQL programs that are generated by the 
 adl_admin_site command. Here is the command lines to execute:</p>
 <table class="code">
   <tr>
     <td>
     <pre>E:\&gt; adl_admin_site -init_db -db_user xxx -db_type monitor -db_size medium -target_dir c:\temp
E:\&gt; adl_admin_site -init_db -db_user xxx -db_type cdb -db_size medium -target_dir c:\temp
E:\&gt; adl_admin_site -init_db -db_user xxx -db_type dept -db_size medium -target_dir c:\temp</pre>
     </td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <p>As shown above the adl_admin_site command must be executed three times to 
 get the SQL programs for the three kinds of tables. Those programs are 
 generated under the directory specified by the -target_dir option.</p>
 <table class="code">

 <p><b>Step 1</b>: the InitInstanceXXX.sql program is the first one to be 
 executed and must be executed only one time on a given database, i.e. if only 
 one database is used for managing monitor, site and configuration management 
 tables, only one of <em>InitInstanceCdb.sql</em>, <em>InitInstanceDept.sql</em> 
 and <em>InitInstanceMonitor.sql</em> programs will be used.</p>
 <p><b>Step 2</b>: each of the CreateTablesXXX.sql programs must be executed on 
 the database that will manage XXX information. If a single database is used, 
 the three programs must be executed on it.<br>
 Notice: several tables are duplicated between databases and then the SQL 
 programs can generate errors when a single database is used.</p>
 <p><b>Step 3</b>: the EstimateStatisticsXXX.sql programs must be executed 
 regularly (weekly for instance) to keep performances to be the best.</p>
 <p>Note: the DropTablesXXX.sql programs are provided just for cleaning up a 
 database before restarting its creation. They must not be used in a normal 
 database initialization process.</p>

 <h4><a name="SCM Databases Connection"></a>SCM Databases Connection</h4>
 <p>By default, the connection to SCM databases is done with &quot;adl&quot; user and &quot;adl&quot; 
 password. To use another user and/or password, execute the adl_admin_site 
 command:</p>
 <table class="code">
   <tr>
     <td>
     <pre>E:\&gt; adl_admin_site -init_db_connect -db_user user -db_password password</pre>
     </td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <p>This command stores the user and the encoded password in the site profile. 
 So, this command must be executed after the installation on each machine.</p>

 create a new file Server database.</p>
 <p>Step 1: declare the new File Server in the central database by the <strong>
 adl_mk_contents_server</strong> command </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Specify the name of the host where the File Server will be launched</li>
   <li>Specify the port number on which it will be listening</li>

     <li>Take care that the -<em>format</em> option must be used only when 
     initializing a new File Server since any data under the two directories 
     will be lost</li>

 <h3><a name="Monitoring commands"></a>Monitoring Commands</h3>
 <p>All commands run under Monitor control. Therefore it is possible to list or 
 control the running commands at any time by retrieving information from the 
 Monitor.</p>
 <p>The <strong>adl_mo_admin</strong> command gives access to information 
 managed by the Monitor process.</p>
 <p>This command is available after setting the environment with the TCK for 
 administration. Here are options available for querying the Monitor.</p>

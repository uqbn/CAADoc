<h3><a name="Setting up"></a>Setting Up the SCM Environment</h3>

<p>SCM is provided as a set of commands. The same commands are available on both
Windows and Unix platforms.<br>
To have access to these commands, open a shell window (on Unix) and a command window (on
Windows) and set up your environment by calling the tck_init profile and executing the
tck_profile command. Please ask your administrator for the exact locations of the tck_init
profile and the tck_profile command.</p>

<p>Once the environment has been set up, all commands are available in the current window.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="creating"></a>Creating a New Workspace</h3>

<p>A workspace is created in a tree [<a href="#References">1</a>] and under an existing
workspace.</p>

<p>For the first workspace to be created in a tree, the command to execute is the <b>adl_mk_root_ws</b>
command.<br>
For the other workspaces, the command to execute is the <b>adl_mk_ws</b> command.</p>

<p>A full description of all parameters and options is available for all SCM commands by
executing the command either with the <code>-h</code> option or <code>-help</code> option
or <code>-?</code> option.</p>

<p>A workspace is identified by a unique name and is created under an existing workspace
(except for the root [<a href="#References">2</a>] workspace). This existing workspace is
called the parent workspace and the new workspace is called a child workspace of this
parent workspace.</p>

<p>If the name of the parent workspace is know by the user, it is not mandatory to specify
the tree where the new workspace will be created. Otherwise the user must select a tree
and lists workspaces belonging to it in order to chose a parent workspace: 

<ul>
  <li>the command to list trees is the <b>adl_ls_tree</b> command.</li>
  <li>the command to list workspaces in a tree is the <b>adl_ls_ws</b> command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that choosing a parent workspace has a consequence for the way the new workspace
will deliver its developments: 

<ul>
  <li>components available in the workspace will be only those available in the parent
    workspace</li>
  <li>new components or changes to existing components will come from the parent workspace
    only.</li>
  <li>any development will be delivered to the parent workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to these rules, workspaces should be created regarding the way development
teams work together. For example, developers working in a common project should create
their workspaces under a common workspace whose purpose will be the integration of their
developments.</p>

<h4><a name="images"></a>Creating Images</h4>

<p>Images [<a href="#References">3</a>] are associated with workspaces and a workspace can
have from 0 to n images. The first image can be created when creating a workspace. Others
images are created afterwards by using the <b>adl_mk_image</b> command.</p>

<p>All images have a name and default names are WINDOWS and UNIX regarding the current
platform where they have been created.</p>

<table class="code">

<p>On Windows, an image path using the UNC format: \\machine\share_name\directory. This
is the default format considering an image can be accessed from different hosts. If a
given image will never be accessed from another host than the one where it is created, a
local path can be used. In that case the <code>-local_dir</code> option must be specified.</p>

<h4><a name="multi-trees"></a>Creating a Multi-tree Workspace</h4>

<p>A multi-tree workspace is a workspace existing in more than one tree. Usually all data
composing a product are managed in a same tree and all users developing this product
create their workspaces in the same tree.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a project development is composed of a lot of components and some users are
working on a subset of these components while others need to have the whole set in their
workspaces. In such a case, the first users will create their workspace in only one tree
(the one managing the subset they need) while the others will create their workspace in
all the trees managing the whole set of components.</p>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><table>
      <caption>Fig 1: Multi-tree Workspaces</caption>

        trees while the other workspace can access only components from one tree.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Single or multi-tree workspaces are created by the same command: <b>adl_mk_ws</b>. The
difference between these two kinds of workspaces is made by using the -tree option when
creating them: if no tree or just one tree is specified at creation time, the workspace is
a (single-tree) workspace, if more than one tree is specified, the workspace will be a
multi-tree workspace.</p>

<table class="code">

<h3><a name="Attaching"></a>Attaching Components</h3>

<p>A workspace is created empty, components must be added to it. Components can either
created or attached in the workspace: 

<ul>
  <li>If a new component is to be managed in a tree, one must chose the workspace where it
    will be registered in SCM. A component can be created in only one workspace.</li>
  <li>The commands to create new components are <b>adl_mk_fw</b>, <b>adl_mk_mod</b> or <b>adl_mk_data</b>
    according to the type of component: framework, module or data.</li>
  <li>If a workspace must contain components declared elsewhere in the same tree, it must
    attach them.</li>
  <li>The command to attach any type of component is the <b>adl_attach</b> command.</li>
</ul>

<p>The attachment follows the rules defined for data flows: 

<ul>
  <li>A component can be attached in a workspace if its parent workspace has already attached
    this component.</li>
  <li>If the parent workspace has not attached the component, it must be synchronized with a
    version of its own parent workspace where this component exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like for any modifications the creation of new components in a workspace is made
visible to the others only when this workspace publishes them and that child workspaces
synchronized themselves. The two following examples show the steps to go through for
attaching in a workspace a component created in another one.</p>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="images/scenario1.gif" width="270" height="360"></td>
    <td>In this scenario the goal is to attach in &quot;Dev1&quot; a new component created in
    &quot;Int&quot; workspace: <ol>
      <li>The component is created in &quot;Int&quot; workspace</li>
      <li>&quot;Int&quot; publishes its content to make the new component visible</li>
      <li>&quot;Prj&quot; synchronizes with the last published version of &quot;Int&quot; in order
        to see the new component</li>
      <li>&quot;Prj&quot; publishes its content to make it visible to its own child workspaces</li>
      <li>&quot;Dev1&quot; synchronizes with the published version of &quot;Prj&quot; in order to
        see the new component</li>
      <li>&quot;Dev1&quot; attaches the new component</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Notes</b>: <ul>
      <li>even the new component is not attached in &quot;Prj&quot; workspace, it is visible for
        the child workspaces (as soon as &quot;Prj&quot; is synchronized with the right state of
        &quot;Int&quot; workspace)</li>
      <li>if some changes are done in the &quot;Dev1&quot; workspace and if it promotes them, the
        collect in &quot;Prj&quot; workspace will attach automatically the framework.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>

</table>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="images/scenario2.gif" width="270" height="270"></td>
    <td>In this scenario, the new component is created in a sibling workspace of the workspace

</table>

<p>SCM manages two kinds of components: the frameworks and the modules (code or data
modules).<br>
There are different ways to attach components depending on the parts the user is
interested in.</p>

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Attachment of the public part of the &quot;fw1&quot; framework, internal modules are not attached:

$ adl_attach fw1

$ adl_attach fw1 -mod

&quot;fw1&quot; being attached in the workspace, attachment of two of its internal modules:

$ adl_attach fw1/mod1.m fw1/CNext.specifics_UNIX

&quot;fw1&quot; being attached in the workspace, attachment of all internal modules not already attached:

$ adl_attach fw1 -attached_fw_mod</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="files and directories"></a>Creating Files and Directories</h3>

<p>Like for components, files and directories come into a workspace either by attaching
them or by creating them. If one user is interested in working on some files already
managed by SCM, he/she can get a copy of them by <a href="#Attaching">attaching</a> the
embedding module and/or framework. Conversely if the files and directories are not yet
registered in SCM, they must be declared using the <b>adl_mk_elem</b> and <b>adl_mk_dir</b>
commands.</p>

<p>An empty file can be declared to SCM but it must exist when calling the adl_mk_elem
command. A empty directory can be declared to SCM but its registration does not lead to
register the internal files at the same time, they must be registered one by one using the
adl_mk_elem command. It is not needed to declared all directories in the path of files,
the registration of a file causes all embedding directories to be registered at the same
time (except for frameworks and modules that must be explicitly registered using either
adl_mk_fw, adl_mk_mod or adl_mk_data commands).</p>

<p>Files and directories cannot be created anywhere under an image [<a href="#References">3</a>]
root directory, SCM commands check that the file and directory paths correspond to a right
location regarding their purpose: 

<ul>
  <li>header files must be created one of the four predefined directories according to their
    scope: <ul>
      <li>&quot;fw/PublicInterfaces&quot; directory contains header files that can be used by
        other components</li>
      <li>&quot;fw/ProtectedInterfaces&quot; directory contains header files that can be used by
        &quot;friend&quot; components (relationships are expressed in IdentityCard.h files)</li>
      <li>&quot;fw/PrivateInterfaces&quot; directory contains header files private to the
        framework and shared by internal modules</li>
      <li>&quot;fw/module/LocalInterfaces&quot; directory contains header files private to the
        module</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>framework are created right under the image root directory</li>
  <li>modules are created right under the corresponding framework directory</li>
</ul>

<p>The following example shows the registration of files that will be associated with the
embedding module and framework. Each &quot;Command successful&quot; message indicates the
end of a transaction, that is to say that each file is created in a separate command.</p>

<h4><a name="Chosing the right type"></a>Choosing the Right Type</h4>

<p>Some predefined types are recognized by SCM. Those types are useful for setting a
specific behavior to all files being registered in SCM.</p>

<p>The type to be associated with a new file is chosen according to the file suffix. If
this suffix is also the name of a predefined type, this type is selected, otherwise the
command is canceled by asking the user to specify a predefined type.</p>

<table class="code">

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>The LCA Navigator/3dcom web application is built the concept of a runtime view (or RTV) from which the application files are loaded at runtime.
      The runtime view consists of a concatenated list of one or more root directories.  The application will search through these directories in order at runtime.
      Thus files in subdirectories beneath the first root directory will be found before files in subdirectories of the last root directory.
      For a customization environment, the product installation directory should be the last directory in the runtime view concatenation list.
      The customization directory should be the first directory in the runtime view concatenation list, so that customized files will be loaded prior to loading the files from the product installation directory.
      Non-programming customization of the LCA Navigator/3dcom installation is accomplished by adding files to the appropriate subdirectories within the customization root directory.
      Each of the customization sections will describe the subdirectories that are involved and the files that must be created.
      Many customizations can be performed simply by adding new files to the customization directories.
      However, occasionally a customization involves updating a file that was shipped by the base product.
      This will be explicitly detailed in that customization section.  In this case, the customer is responsible for dual maintaining any product fixes applied to this file into the customized version of the file.

<h3><a name="Typesofcustomization"></a>What is customization</h3>
<p>There are several types of customizations which can be done in the LCA Navigator User Interface.
They main ways to customize the client are:
New Object Types: The user can exposed new object types which have been created in the ENOVIA V5 server.
New Object Commands: For any object in the User Interface it is possible to create and register a new command for that object.
These commands can appear in the toolbar or contextual menu depending on how the command is registered.
Custom Navigation: The primary and secondary relationships can be modified.
Custom Color scheme: The Relationship Navigator color scheme is based on the lifecycle state of an object.
The color used for each object type/lifecycle state can be modified.</p>

       <h3>Abstract</h3>
       <p>This article is the first one to read to start on an integration 
       between CATIA V5 and an external PDM system. It first explains in what an 
       integration consists in. Then to understand the details of this 
       integration, it presents CATIA V5 concepts on the data that will be 
       exchanged between the two applications, e.g. V5 documents. Finally, the 
       article finishes by a set of rules to be strictly respected in order to 
       succeed an integration with CATIA V5.</p>

   <h3><a name="Extrenal PDM System"></a><b>External PDM System</b></h3>
   <p>This section succinctly defines what is a PDM and what is its role either 
   in the CATIA V5 integration, or intrinsically. </p>
   <h4><a name="External PDM System Definition"></a>Definition </h4>
   <p>A product data management (PDM) system is a software that enables 
   manufacturers to store, archive, manage and control engineering information, 
   specifically, data surrounding new product designs and engineering processes.
   </p>
   <p>The data is:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Files</b>: CATIA V5 document files and their associated files. </li>
     <li><b>Meta data</b>: document attributes and document relationship 
     information. </li>
   </ul>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h4><a name="External PDM System Integration with CATIA V5"></a>Integration 
   with CATIA V5</h4>
   <p>The purpose of the integration between an external PDM System and CATIA V5 
   is to enable the management of the data from CATIA V5 within the PDM. It 
   consists in implementing a communication channel between them through which 
   the data are transferred under the PDM control.&nbsp; </p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber2">
     <caption><a name="Fig.1">Fig.1</a> Integration Functional View</caption>
     <tr>
       <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainSchema.jpg" width="629" height="317"></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The data which are stored into the PDM are always created 
   in a CATIA V5 session. These data, V5 documents, must be saved on disk to be 
   persistent. It is this persistent view which will be stored in the PDM. Once 
   the documents are in the PDM it can be encrypted into a secure vault, but in 
   all cases the PDM must give back the same V5 documents as those provided by 
   CATIA V5. </p>
   <p>The scenario consisting in transfering CATIA V5 documents 
   to the external PDM system is named <b>Check-In</b> scenario. In opposite, 
   the scenario consisting in extracting CATIA V5 documents from the external 
   PDM system is named <b>Check-Out</b> scenario. They are main scenarios that 
   you should implement for this integration.</p>
   <p>The <b>Client Integration</b> is the CATIA software used 
   by the integration scenario to:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Control the consistency of the persistent documents</li>
     <li>Make easier the file transfer&nbsp; to the PDM</li>
     <li>Provide information to fill up the PDM meta data.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The purpose of the external PDM system is to manage V5 
   documents in its file repository. However, CATIA, and <b>only</b> <b>CATIA, 
   ensures</b> the <b>V5 document consistency</b> by this software layer. This 
   software layer is the APIs of the CATxPDMInterfaces framework, and which 
   requires the <b>PX1</b> license. </p>
   <p>The <b>user Work</b> area is the dedicated directory to 
   store the persistent files accessible by CATIA. This directory is the 
   exchange area for files transfer between the two applications. </p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h4><a name="Document Management Capability"></a>Document Management 
   Capability</h4>
   <p>The document into the external PDM system can be seen as a set of 
   information that we can sum up like this:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Key Attributes</li>
     <li>Meta Data</li>
     <li>Revision Status ( Release, In work )</li>
     <li>Edition Status (Lock or unlock)</li>
     <li>Representation 1 (the V5 document file)</li>
     <li>Representation 2 (the Preview file of the V5 document)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The PDM system should propose a <b>Document Management</b> capability. It 
   means provide services to be able to do:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Document Registration: Initialize a reference to a document into the 
     PDM</li>
     <li>Document Identification by key attributes </li>
     <li>Document Check-In:&nbsp; Store a document into the PDM vault</li>
     <li>Document Check-Out: Extract a document from the PDM vault</li>
     <li>Document Encryption: Secure the document&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
     <li>Document Revision status Management: Release, In work </li>
     <li>Document Edition Status Management: Lock or unlock a document (check 
     out a document locks a document, but it can be another reasons)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The Check-In and Check-Out scenarios use these base services. </p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h3><a name="CATIA V5 Concepts"></a>CATIA V5 Concepts</h3>
   <p>This section presents the main concepts of the CATIA V5 in the domain of 
   the documents. </p>
   <h4><b>V5 Document Links</b></h4>
   <p>As you perform design operations within a CATIA session, CATIA creates 
   internal links between documents. In the following example [<a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>], 
   the publication &quot;Face&quot; belonging to Part1 has been copied and pasted &quot;as 
   result with link&quot; in Part2 in the Product1 context. </p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber3">
     <caption><a name="Fig.2">Fig.2</a> Copy and Paste in Assembly Context</caption>
     <tr>
       <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainLinksDoc.jpg" width="197" height="205"></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>Within the interactive session, the end user can use the <b>Links</b> 
   command (in the Edit menu) to understand the type of links, in other words 
   their semantic. This information can only be visible into an interactive 
   session, since only CATIA application can provide the link's information. The
   <a href="#Fig.3">Fig.3</a> is the snapshot of the Links command describing 
   the links semantic from Product1.</p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber4">
     <caption><a name="Fig.3">Fig.3</a> Edit/Links Command For Product1</caption>
     <tr>
       <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainEditLinksProduct1.jpg" width="331" height="93"></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The<a href="#Fig.4"> Fig.4</a> is the snapshot describing the links 
   semantic from Part2.</p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber5">
     <caption><a name="Fig.4">Fig.4</a> Edit/Links Command For Part2</caption>
     <tr>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainEditLinksPart2.jpg" width="453" height="105"></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The following picture, <a href="#Fig.5">Fig.5</a>, is a schematic view of 
   these links with their semantic. </p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber6" width="358">
     <caption><a name="Fig.5">Fig.5</a> </caption>
     <tr>
       <td width="351"><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainLinksSchema.jpg" width="257" height="221"></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>You can also use the <b>Desk</b> command (in the File menu) to display the 
   network of documents in session [<a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a>]. </p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" 
   id="AutoNumber7">
     <caption><a name="Fig.6">Fig.6</a></caption>
     <tr>
       <td><img border="0" src="images/CAAXpiMainFileDesk.jpg" width="569" height="87"><p>&nbsp;</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The graph is organized in such way that <b>root documents</b> appear on 
   the left [<a href="#Fig.6">Fig.6</a>]. A root document is the document 
   associated with the object which manages the visualization of this document, 
   and its components. This object is an editor. Refer to the Wintop Frame 
   articles for more details about the editor. </p>
   <p>The document are interactively made persistent on disk using the <b>Save 
   Management </b>command. But once the document are outside a CATIA Session, an 
   external PDM system does not have access to the relationship between the 
   documents, and consequently does not have access also to the type of links 
   between document. </p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h4><b><a name="Consistent Set of Documents"></a>Consistent Set of Documents</b></h4>
   <p>The Consistent Set Of Documents is a group of documents. These documents 
   may have dependencies (links) on other documents. The group becomes a 
   Consistent Set of Documents when all theses dependencies are solved within 
   the group. This means that the whole CATIA design intent is captured in this 
   group of documents, and, then by modifying, moving, renaming theses documents 
   in this special context ensures that the knowledge is kept consistent and 
   secure.</p>
   <p>The Integration scenarios should never process a document as single 
   document but should always consider this document in the context of the 
   Consistent Set of Document this document belongs to. </p>
   <p>The identification of a Consistent Set of Document must be performed among 
   the persistent files saved on disk. The integration must ensure that the V5 
   documents still in session are saved in the user Work area before computing 
   the Consistent Set.</p>
   <p>We recommend the following methodology to identify the consistent set</p>
   <ol>
     <li>First, identify the root documents contained in the user Work area. A 
     root document is a document being at the top of the dependency hierarchy&nbsp;
     </li>
     <li>For a root document, compute the document dependencies and check that 
     there is no missing document that would break the consistency of the group&nbsp;
     </li>
     <li>Among the several Consistent Set of documents you have retrieved from 
     the Root documents, locate in which Set your document belongs to</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Applying this methodology, you are able to identify to which set every 
   document of the user Work area belongs to. Refer to the &quot;Checking the 
   Consistent Set of Files for V5 Documents&quot; [<a href="#References">6</a>] use 
   case for details about the consistent set of documents and the root 
   documents. </p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h4><a name="Document Properties"></a>Document Properties</h4>
   <p>A CATIA V5 document contains properties:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Standard</b> properties
     <ul>
       <li>CN_PART_NUMBE</li>
       <li>CN_REVISON</li>
       <li>CN_DEFINITION</li>
       <li>CN_NOMENCLATURE</li>
       <li>CN_DESCRIPTIONREF</li>

       <li>CN_MASS</li>
       <li>CN_SURFACE</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>User </b>properties </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Interactively you modify or create new user properties using the <b>
   Properties</b> command ( Contextual menu) , or using the <b>Fx</b> command [<a 
   href="#Fig.7">Fig.7</a>]. </p>
   <table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111"

   <p>The <i>CATIxPDMItem</i> interface enables you to retrieve or modify the 
   document properties. <br>

   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h3><a name="Integration Specifications"></a>Integration 
   Specifications</h3>
   <p>This section first presents four identified scenarios to 
   implement. Then it points the main rules to be followed to ensure a 
   successful integration. </p>
   <h4><a name="Scenario Cases"></a>Scenario Cases</h4>
   <p>In the first section, two scenarios have been identified [<a 
   href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>] </p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Check-In</b> Scenario [<a href="#References">1</a>]
     <p>Check-In is a scenario whereby CATIA session information 
     and persistent documents are used to create new or modify existing PDM 
     system data. Check-In enables save a consistent set of documents from CATIA 
     V5 in the external PDM system with the appropriate document links exposure. 
     These document links information must be sufficient for the Integration to 
     compute the right consistent set of documents once the documents are stored 
     in the PDM, and not anymore under CATIA control. </p>
     </li>
     <li><b>Check-Out</b> Scenario [<a href="#References">2</a>]
     <p>Check-Out is a scenario whereby CATIA V5 documents are extracted from 
     the PDM system repository to be opened in the interactive CATIA session. 
     Check-Out enables extract a consistent set of documents that has been 
     checked-In previously. It reuses the document link information, stored at 
     Check-In step, to compute the consistent set of documents in order to 
     ensure the CATIA session consistency.</p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   <p>Beside these two base scenarios, two others can be 
   implemented:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Rename</b> scenario [<a href="#References">3</a>]
     <p>Rename is a scenario whereby a document already stored in 
     PDM system is renamed. The consistent set of document this document belongs 
     to must be updated accordingly in order to keep links integrity. </p>
     </li>
     <li><b>Derivative Design Copy</b> Scenario [<a href="#References">4</a>]
     <p>Derivative Design Copy is a scenario whereby a consistent 
     set of documents stored in a PDM system is duplicated to allow manage a 
     derivative design variant of this set.</p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   <p>These four scenarios, detailed step by step in dedicated 
   articles, referenced by the number in brackets, can be implemented by an 
   interactive or a batch command. For interactive commands, it can be 
   recommended to insert these commands in an Add-in of the General workshop. It 
   enables the end user to benefit these commands whatever the active document 
   type. Refer to the frame article [<a href="#References">5</a>] to have 
   complete information about this specific Add-in. </p>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <h4><a name="Rules to Respect"></a>Rules to be Followed</h4>
   <p>The integration implementation must enforce the following 
   rules: </p>
   <ol>
     <li><b>Work </b>with consistent set of documents
       <p>Even you want to rename, to store, or to display one document, you 
       must work with the consistent set of documents belonging to the selected 
       document. It is the only one way to ensure the document links 
       consistency.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
       <p>In the same way, you should never save one document, but always a 
       consistent set of documents. Interactively, the end user should invoke 
       the Save management command, and by code you have the <code>
       SaveSessionToDirectory</code> method of the <i>CATxPDMSessionServices</i> 
       class. </p>
      </li>
     <li><b>Let </b>the Product Structure operations under the 
     CATIA V5</li> control</p>
       <p>You must not modify the structure of a Product document outside an 
       CATIA V5 Session, otherwise you are sure to lost the document links 
       consistency. It is valid for any kind of V5 document type. CATIA V5 
       controls, and then guarantees the data consistency. </p>
     </li>
     <li><b>Use</b> the User Work area 
     [<a href="#Fig.1">Fig.1</a>]
       <p>It is a dedicated directory to transfer the V5 documents between the 
       two applications. </p>
       <ul>
         <li>The PDM system extracts document from its secure repository, and 
         copies them into the dedicated directory</li>
         <li>The Save operation driven by a CATIA session is done in this same 
         directory</li>
       </ul>
       <p>You must be sure that this directory</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Cannot be shared by several users ( one directory for one user)</li>
         <li>Is under CATIA control&nbsp; </li>
         <li>Is not used for any purpose than Save management, Check-In and 
         Check-Out operations. </li>
         </li>
       </ul>
       <p>It is mandatory that the documents, once copied into the user Work 
       area, have their original CATIA document names. Moreover, if the document 
       is loaded in session it must not be removed from the user Work directory.</li>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li><b>Ensure</b> CATIA V5 Document identification within the 
     PDM
       <p>Every CATIA document name must be unique inside the PDM system. </p>
     </li>
   </ol>
   <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
   <hr>
   <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
   <h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
   <p>The integration consists mainly in implementing two scenarios:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Check-In </li>
     <li>Check-Out</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These scenarios, such as all integration scenarios must never process one 
   document, but the consistent set of documents&nbsp; this document belong to. 
   It is the only mean to ensure the document links consistency. By using the 
   specific CATIA V5 software layer (PX1 APIs - <i>CATxPDMInterfaces</i> 
   framework) in your scenarios, it guarantees that the exchange between the two 
   applications will be safely done.</p>

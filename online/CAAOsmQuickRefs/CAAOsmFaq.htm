<p><b><a name="DeleteFeature"></a>What interfaces should I use to delete a 
   feature?</b></p>

   
<p>Use the <i>LifeCycleObject</i>::<code>remove</code> method when the 
   feature to be deleted is not aggregated by another feature. However, if it 
   itself aggregates other features, these will be deleted as well. Use the <i>
   CATISpecObject</i>::<code>GetFather</code> method to know if the feature is 
   aggregated or not.</p>

   
<p>Use <i>CATISpecObject</i>::<code>Remove</code>(<i>CATISpecObject_var</i>) 
   to delete an aggregated feature. This method is executed on the aggregating 
   feature with the aggregated feature to be destroyed passed as an input 
   parameter.</p>

   
<p>Use <i>CATICutAndPastable</i>::<code>Remove</code> on any feature, whether 
   aggregated or aggregating.&nbsp;<p:colorscheme colors="#FFFFFF,#3365FB,#3365FB,#081D58,#00DFCA,#EAEC5E,#00DFCA,#A2C1FE">
   </p:colorscheme>
   </p>

   
<p><b><a name="PointingFeature"></a>When deleting a feature, how can I know 
   if there are other features already pointing to it?</b></p>

   
<p>Either one of two methods can be used to know if the feature you want to 
   delete is currently being pointed at: </p>

   
<ol>

     <li><i>CATISpecObject</i>::<code>InverseAttrLink.</code></li>

     <li><i>CATISpecAttrAccess</i>::<code>ListPointingObjects</code>.&nbsp;</li>

   
</ol>

   
<p>If the returned list of either method is not NULL, this means that other 
   features are pointing to the feature you want to delete through a <code>
   tk_component</code> or <code>tk_specobject</code> link&nbsp;</p>

   
<p><b><a name="ccp"></a></b><b>The CCP/Delete options in the contextual menu 
   are not enabled for my feature. What must I do to enable them?</b></p>

   
<p>You need to re-implement the CATICsoFilter interface of ApplicationFrame. 
   However, you must first be sure that if the current UIActive object also 
   implements this interface, it allows its re-implementation by others. This is 
   the case in a Product document, but it may not be true in another context.
   </p>

   
<p><b><a name="ChgName"></a>How can I change the name of a feature?</b></p>

   
<p>There are two ways to do this:&nbsp;</p>

   
<ol>

     <li>Use <i>CATISpecObject</i>::<code>SetDisplayName</code>. This method 
     changes the name of the feature seen in the specs tree. It is not a 
     persistent change, i.e., if the document is saved and re-opened, the 
     feature's old name will appear in the specs tree again.</li>

     <li>Use the <i>CATIAlias</i>::<code>SetAlias</code> method to permanently 
     change the name of a feature. If the feature is not a DS or DS-derived 
     feature, you must&nbsp; override this interface in order to provide a 
     persistent storage location for the new name.</li>

   
</ol>

   
<p>It may be important to understand how the default implementations actually 
   work:</p>

   
<ul>

     <li>The default specs tree navigation process uses <i>CATIAlias</i>::<code>GetAlias</code> 
     to retrieve the name of a feature.&nbsp;</li>

     <li>Initially, <i>CATIAlias</i>::<code>GetAlias</code> returns the name 
     calculated by <i>CATISpecObject</i>::<code>GetDisplayName</code>: this is a 
     name based on the NLS text available for the feature.</li>

     <li>Executing <i>CATIAlias</i>::<code>SetAlias</code> on a feature also 
     updates its display name which means that the NLS name is lost.</li>

   
</ul>

   
<p><b><a name="IntegrateFeature"></a>I have created a new feature in my 
   document but I cannot visualize its geometry nor see it in the specification 
   tree. What do I need to do?</b></p>

   
<p>First of all, it is necessary for your feature to implement the <i>
   CATI3DGeoVisu</i> interface (or equivalent, deriving from <i>CATIVisu</i>) 
   for geometry visualization and the <i>CATINavigateObject</i> interface for 
   visualization and navigation in the specification tree. If this has been 
   done, then it is only necessary to refresh the visualization process and the 
   specification tree. This is done using the <i>CATIModelEvents</i> interface. 
   Here is a code example you can follow:</p>

   
<pre>CATIModelEvents *piModelEventNewFeat = NULL;<br><br>rc = piNewFeat-&gt;<b>QueryInterface</b> (IID_CATIModelEvents, (void**)&amp;piModelEventNewFeat);<br><br>if (SUCCEEDED(rc))<br>{<br>   CATCreate notif (piNewFeat, piParentFeat);<br><br>   piModelEventNewFeat-&gt;<b>Dispatch</b>(notif);<br><br>   piModelEventNewFeat-&gt;<b>Release</b>();<br>   piModelEventNewFeat=NULL;<br></pre>

   
<div style="text-align: left;">
     }</div>

   
<p>In the above code, you can see that, first of all, you need to retrieve a
   <i>CATIModelEvents</i> pointer on your new feature. Then, you initialize a <i>
   CATCreate</i> notification with the parent feature of the new feature and 
   then execute the <code>Dispatch</code> method of <i>CATIModelEvents</i> to 
   dispatch the notification. Next, for visualization in the specification tree, 
   simply use the <i>CATIRedrawEvents</i>::<code>Redraw</code> method on the 
   parent node of your new feature.</p>
<p><b><a name="ExtensionInGraph"></a></b><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
use Extension Features onMechanical Features. I see them in the
specifications tree for surfacic item but not for solid item, why?</span></p>

   Behaviors such as visualisation in the specifications tree or
parameter display in f(x) are dependant of the extended feature.You
should always refer to the corresponding documentation of the extended
feature to confirm that the behaviors you experienced are specified and
supported. If not documented, it means the behavior is not supported.<br>

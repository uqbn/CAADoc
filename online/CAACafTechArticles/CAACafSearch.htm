<h3><a name="Principles"></a>Principles</h3>
<p>The Edit/Search interactive command enables you to look for objects in the
current V5 document. This command uses an API detailed in this article and which
is located in the InteractiveInterfaces framework. It is significant to say that
this API offers more possibilities than the command itself.</p>
<p>The aim is to look for elements inside a document that match a criterion or a
combination of criteria. The process is as follows: a <b>criterion</b> and a
scope of search (called the <b>context</b>) are defined and fed into the search
engine.</p>
<p>For the criteria, detailed in the <a href="#Criteria Definition">Criteria
Definition</a> section, two cases can be distinguished:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Criteria used to carry out simple queries, in other words those possible
    through the Search command <b>General</b> tab page.</li>
  <li>Criteria used to carry out queries with Knowledge parameters, in other
    words those possible through the <b>Advanced</b> tab page.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact there is a third category of criterion, the <b>combination</b>
criterion. It enables to compose criteria through logical operations to create
only one criterion to set as parameter of the search engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The architecture of the API is based on the components [1]. A criterion is a
component, the context is a component and a component will be created to launch
a query. This is explained in the <a href="#Mechanism based on Components and Interfaces">Mechanism
Based on Components and Interfaces</a> section.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, there is a section about the Knowledge. The <a href="#Packages, Types and Attributes">Workbench,
Package, Type and Attribute</a> section defines briefly the notions of
workbenches, package, type and attribute, and details how to retrieve these
objects.</p>
<p>To be complete, it should be specified that there is a use case entitled
&quot;Creating Search Queries&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="#References">2</a>]. Through
some examples, it shows how to create and launch queries, and it gives you some
tips not detailed here.</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="Criteria Definition"></a>Criterion&nbsp; Definition</h3>
<p>In this section, all the criteria will be described. In fact, the following
questions will be answered each time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is this criterion,</li>
  <li>What are the specificities for the objects to be a candidat for the
    criterion,</li>
  <li>What are the possibilities of comparison between the value of the
    criterion and the value associated with each object.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="General Criteria"></a>General Criteria</h4>
<p>This picture shows the General tag page of the Search command.</p>
<table border="0">
  <caption><a name="Fig.1">Fig.1</a>: The General Tab Page</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchGeneral.jpg" width="496" height="376"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The criteria are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Name</b> Criterion</li>
  <p>In interactive mode, the criterion is obtained by unchecking the &quot;As
  displayed in graph&quot; button. It enables to look for objects by their
  external name. It is the name returned by <i>CATIAlias</i> or <i>CATI</i><i>NavigateObject
  </i>if <i>CATIAlias</i> is not supported. The comparison operator between the
  value of the criterion and those associated with objects can only be a
  difference or an equality.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>Graph Name </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>In interactive mode, the criterion is obtained by checking the &quot;As
  displayed in graph&quot; button. It enables to look for objects by the name
  displayed in the specification tree. It is the name returned by <i>CATINavigateObject</i>.
  The comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those
  associated with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<p>The other criteria&nbsp;imply only objects implementing the <i>CATIVisProperties
interface </i>[<a href="#References">3</a>].</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Color </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>The criterion is based on the object's color. If an object has several
  color (a color for its different sub-elements), the color of the geometry
  displayed in the Graphic Properties toolbar will be used as a reference for
  comparison. Refer to the article &quot;Graphical Properties&quot;&nbsp;<i> </i>[<a href="#References">3</a>]
  for more details about the choice of the geometry used in the graphic toolbar.
  The comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those
  associated with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Visibility </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>The criterion is based on the visibility state of an object. The comparison
  operator between the value of the criterion and those associated with objects
  can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>Layer </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>The criterion is based on the layer. The comparison operator between the
  value of the criterion and those associated with objects can be anything
  (equality, difference , superior, inferior, superior or equal, inferior or
  equal).</p>
  <li>The <b>Weight </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>The criterion is based on the line thickness. It only applies to linear
  objects (<code>CATVPLine</code> geometry but not <code>CATVPEdge</code> [<a href="#References">3</a>]).
  All the comparison signs are accepted.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>Dashed</b>&nbsp;Criterion</li>
  <p>The criterion is based on the line type. It only applies to linear objects
  (<code>CATVPLine</code> geometry but not <code>CATVPEdge</code> [<a href="#References">3</a>]).
  The comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those
  associated with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Advanced Criteria"></a>Advanced Criteria</h4>
<p>This second picture shows the Advanced tab page of the Search command.</p>
<table border="0">
  <caption><a name="Fig.2">Fig.2</a>: The Advanced Tab Page</caption>

    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchAdvanced.jpg" width="497" height="377"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The queries available in advanced mode are based on the knowledge
infrastructure. An advanced criterion is a logical combination between a <b>type</b>
based criterion <b>and eventually </b>an <b>attribute</b> based criterion whose
attribute is linked to the designed type. The <a href="#Packages, Types and Attributes">Package,
Type and Attribute</a> section gives you more details about knowledge
parameters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>Type</b> Criterion</p>
<p>This criterion enables you to carry out a search based on a knowledge type (<i>CATIType</i>).
The comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those associated
with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>Attribute</b> Criteria</p>
<p>These criteria are based on the knowledge attribute. They are the
following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Boolean</b> Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any Knowledge attribute that is defined as boolean. The
  comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those associated
  with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>Dimension </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any Knowledge attribute that uses units, like the diameter
  of a hole, the first length of a pad, and so one. The comparison operator
  between the value of the criterion and those associated with objects can be
  anything (equality, difference , superior, inferior, superior or equal,
  inferior or equal).</p>
  <li>The <b>Integer </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any integer type Knowledge attribute. There are two kinds of
  criterion: with one comparison value or with a range of values comparison. In
  the first case, the comparison operator can be anything, and in the second
  case the comparison operator can be only a difference (the value is outside
  the range) or an equality (inside the range).</p>
  <li>The <b>Listing </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any a finite list of values Knowledge attribute. The
  comparison operator between the value of the criterion and those associated
  with objects can only be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>Real </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any real type Knowledge attribute. There are two kinds of
  criterion: with one comparison value or with a range of values comparison. In
  the first case, the comparison operator can be anything, and in the second
  case the comparison operator can be only a difference (the value is outside
  the range) or an equality (inside the range).</p>
  <li>The <b>String </b>Criterion</li>
  <p>This refers to any string type Knowledge attribute. The comparison operator
  between the value of the criterion and those associated with objects can only
  be a difference on an equality.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>The <b>User </b>Criterion</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>This criterion has to be used to look for objects that have a user-defined
  type attribute. The authorized comparison operators sign values depend on the
  attribute's type (boolean, dimensioned, integer, listing, real or string).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Combinaison Criteria"></a>Combination Criteria</h4>
<p align="left">A query is composed of one criterion and one context. But a
criterion can be a combination of elementary criteria. There are three kind of
combination:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>And</b> : The found element should be available for the
    two criteria,</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Or : </b>The found element should be available for at
    least one criterion,</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Except : </b>The found element should be available for
    the first criterion but not for the second.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">These three logical combinations are consequently a criterion.
This criterion has two criteria as parameters for the logical operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" width="31" height="30"><b>About
the criteria order</b></p>
<p align="left">If the And and Or logical operations are commutative operations,
the order for the parameter is important:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Between a <b>type</b> criterion and an <b>attribute</b>
    criterion, the type criterion must be the first operand,</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">For an And operation, the most discriminant criteria should
    be the first operand,</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">For an Or operation, the least discriminant criteria should
    be the first operand.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Query Definition"></a>Query Definition</h3>
<p>A search query enables you to look for objects in a V5 document. Several
aspects of a query are explained here under.</p>
<h4><a name="Context"></a>Context</h4>
<p>A query is composed of a criterion and a context. The context defines the
limits to look for objects.This is important: useful to decrease the research
time and to define the scope of the research.The search into the document is
based on the specification tree representation. There exist six types of scope:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everywhere (all)</li>
  <p>To look for objects located anywhere in the document.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>InUIActiveObject (in)</li>
  <p>To look for objects located between the current UI-Active object [<a href="#References">4</a>]
  (called top object) and the next UI-Activable objects located below this top
  object (called bottom objects). Objects located under those UI-activable
  objects are not taken into account. The top object and all bottom objects are
  included in the search.</p>
  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchContext1.jpg" width="248" height="460"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>If the UI-active object is <code>UI-Active Object 1.1</code> (the
  underlined object) all the red and in italic font elements in the above
  diagram are taken into account during the search process.</p>
  <li>FromUIActiveObjectToBottom (from)</li>
  <p>To look for objects located from the current UI-Active object [<a href="#References">4</a>]
  (called top object) to the very bottom of the specification tree for this
  branch. The top object is included in the search process.</p>
  <table border="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchContext2.jpg" width="235" height="444"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>If the UI-active object is <code>UI-Active Object 1.1</code> (the
  underlined object) all the red and in italic font elements in the above
  diagram are taken into account during the search process.</p>
  <li>FromSelection (sel)</li>
  <p>To look for objects located in the current set of objects of the editor ( <i>CATCSO</i>
  [<a href="#References">4</a>] ) as well as other objects located underneath in
  the specification tree.&nbsp;</p>
  <li>OnSameLevel&nbsp;</li>
  <p>To look for objects located on the same specification tree level as a
  reference object. This scope is not possible in the Search command.&nbsp;</p>

	<li>VisibleOnScreen&nbsp; </li>
		<p>To look for objects visible (fully 
		or not) in the current active window. This context won't take into 
		account elements not activated, not represented (features used to build 
		other features that appear in the specification tree but not in 3D), not 
		in the current active filter, not in the current mask... and when the 2D 
		mode is activated elements not in the active plane are excluded from the 
		search result too. <strong>Caution</strong>: 
		this scope must not be used in a batch. The result would be 
		unpredictable.</p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="TransFormat versus NLS Format"></a><a name="TransFormat versus NLS Format">
NLS versus </a>Transformat Format</h4>
<p>In an interactive session you can create queries through the dialog objects
(such as combo boxes) of the Search command. But in the Advanced tab page, see <a href="#Fig.2">Fig.2</a>,
you can also enter a string to formulate a criterion. Imagine you enter the
&quot;Couleur='Base 25' &amp; Trait=plein&quot; text as follows:</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchQueryInFrench.jpg" width="489" height="316"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you are in a French session, this query will be successfully analyzed and
processed. But the same query in a none English session is not valid. This is
why it is important to use the <b>transformat</b> format, a session language
independent format. If you now enter the following text, <code>Color='(255,0,0)'
&amp; dashed=1)</code>, the query will be valid whatever the language session.</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchQueryInTransformat.jpg" width="497" height="337"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To interactively translate a query from the NLS format to the transformat
format, you record a macro command on a Search command based scenario with the
appropriate query.</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> Menu, select <b>Macro </b>and <b>Start Recording</b></li>
  <li>Click <b>Start</b> in the <b>Record Macro </b>dialog box.</li>
  <li>On the <b>Edit</b> Menu, click <b>Search</b></li>
  <li><b>Create</b> interactively the query</li>
  <li>Click <b>Search</b></li>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> Menu, select <b>Macro </b>and <b>Stop Recording</b></li>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> Menu, select <b>Macro </b>and<b> Macros</b></li>
  <li><b>Edit</b> the macro</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the macro file:</p>

  <li><code>(Color='(255,0,0)' &amp; Dashed=1)</code> is the criterion&nbsp;</li>
  <li><code>all</code> is the context.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>All criteria interfaces derive from the <i>CATIIniSearchCriterion</i>
    interface. This interface contains methods criterion type independent:
    transformation of a criterion in an NLS or a transformat string for
    example.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The three combination criteria derive from the <i>CATIIniSearchCombinationCriterion</i>
    interface, but you don't have to use this interface.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>All the general Criteria (color, weight,...) are summarized by the
    GeneralCriterion box</li>
  <li>All the Advanced Criteria ( type, boolean,...) are summarized by the

<h3><a name="Packages, Types and Attributes"></a>Workbench, Package, Type and
Attribute</h3>
<p>In the advanced queries, you should be familiar with some knowledge&nbsp;
objects: workbench, packages, type and attribute.&nbsp;To sum up a workbench is
a group of packages, which is itself a group of types, and a type is a group of
attributes. The section begins to explain the package notion, and ends by
explanation about workbench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <b>package</b> defines a set of types. All the types are &quot;stored&quot;
in a dictionary. To retrieve a smart pointer on the unique type dictionary, you
can use the static <code>GetTypeDictionary</code> method of the <i>CATGlobalFunction</i>
class.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
   <b>CATITypeDictionary</b>_var pITypeDictionary;
   pITypeDictionary = <b>CATGlobalFunctions</b>::<b>GetTypeDictionary</b>();
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>A type is handled through a <i>CATIType</i> interface. To retrieve a pointer
on a type, you can use the <code>FindTypeInPackage</code> method on the <i>CATITypeDictionary
</i>interface pointer.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
  CATIType_var spITypeToFind;
  CATUnicodeString InternalTypeName =&quot;Hole&quot;;
  CATUnicodeString PackageName = &quot;PartDesign&quot; ;
  
  rc = pITypeDictionary -&gt;<b>FindTypeInPackage</b>(InternalTypeName,
                                            PackageName ,
                                            spITypeToFind);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">The first two arguments of this method respectively are the
internal name of a type and its package . The following scenario gives you the
means to know the list of packages and for each of them the list of types and
their associated attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the <b>Tools</b> Menu, click <b>Options</b></li>
  <li>Select the <b>Language</b> tab page of&nbsp;<b>General/Parameters and
    Measure</b></li>
  <li>Select all the packages or only the necessary</li>
  <li>On the <b>Start</b> Menu, click <b>Knowledge Expert</b></li>
  <li>Launch <b>Expert Check</b>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchKnowExpertCheck.jpg" width="29" height="26"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Ok</b> in the dialog box</li>
  <li>In the <b>Check Editor</b> dialog box click <img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchKnowCheckEditor.jpg" width="28" height="25"></li>
</ol>
<p>The following dialog box appears:</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchBrowserAttribute.jpg" width="577" height="305"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The first column displays the list of packages, the second column displays
the type contained by the selected package, and the last column displays the
list of attributes for the selected type. All the names are internal name, in
other words language independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Internal name versus NLS name</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Package</b> : There is no NLS name for packages</li>
  <li><b>Type</b>: <code>UserName</code> on the <i>CATIType</i> interface
    provides the NLS name of a type</li>
  <li><b>Attribute</b>: the <i>CATAttributeInfo</i> class contains a method to
    retrieve the NLS name.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>workbench</b>, knowledge sense, groups together packages. It is without
relationship with the workbench of a V5 document [<a href="#References">4</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchWorkbenchDef.jpg" width="526" height="409"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The workbench is only used for the Search Mechanism. The following picture
shows some of them in the Search command.</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img border="0" src="images/CAACafSearchWorkbench.jpg" width="465" height="185"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In the Search command, you must choose a workbench to launch a query. The
workbench enables us to provide a limited list of types (second combo). The
first combo could have been a package name, but the notion of package is too
short. A workbench groups together a &quot;logical&quot; set of types.</p>
<p>The workbench entity is optional for the Search API. To create a <a href="#Advanced Criteria">type</a>
criterion, only a <i>CATIType</i> interface pointer is mandatory. Lets us see
the <code>SetParameters</code> method of the <i>CATIIniSearchTypeCriterion</i>
interface.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
  virtual HRESULT <b>SetParameters</b> (const CATIType* iSearchedType, 
                                 CATIniSearchEnumeration::Comparison iOperatingSign,
                                 CATUnicodeString <b>iWorkbenchInternalName</b>=&quot;&quot;) = 0;                                                                                                              
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><code>iWorkbenchInternalName</code> is optional, you can set an empty string.
Specifying the name of the workbench can be useful if you want display the query
and inform your end users that the type provide from such or such workbench.</p>
<p><code>iWorkbenchInternalName</code> is an internal name, it is not the NLS
name displayed by the Search command. To retrieve the internal name from the NLS
name, follow the <a href="#Scenario">scenario</a> which uses a VB macro.</p>

    <p>Arranging dialog objects in a dialog window, a dialog box, a frame or a tab page, that
    is a container, consists in positionning each object at a given place with respect to the
    others. The container layout will then not changed when the dialog window is resized.<ul>

<h3><a name="100000"></a>Dialog Object Layout</h3>

<p>The main parameters for object layout are the dimensions and the assigned position of
each object. Objects are automatically sized using their contents when they are
instantiated. For example, a label size is computed using the number of characters that
the label title includes, and a multilist size is computed using the number of rows and
columns. You can arrange the dialog objects inside their container. In addition, you can
allow some objects to be resizable when the whole window is resized. </p>

<p>Arranging dialog objects within a container applies to the following containers, which
are instances of the CATDlgDocument, CATDlgDialog, CATDlgFrame, and CATDlgTabPage classes.
For other container classes, the layout is predetermined and cannot be customized,
because: 

<ul>
  <li>They can't have any child: CATDlgNotify and CATDlgFile</li>
  <li>They can have a single child: CATDlgContainer</li>
  <li>The layout is imposed: CATDlgSplitter, CATDlgBar</li>
  <li>The layout is specific to the object's representation: CATDlgMenu, CATDlgTabContainer,
    and CATDlgIconBox. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have complex windows with containers which include many objects, you need to
arrange your containers and their contents. It is advisable to arrange your window
container by container, beginning with the main container. You can refer to the
&quot;The Burger Order Dialog Box&quot; use case [<a href="#References">1</a>] to see how the
frames as well as their labels, separators and the bottom push buttons were first
arranged, and then how the contents of each of the three frames were arranged afterwards. </p>

<p>There are two ways of arranging dialog objects within a container: the grid layout
and
the tabulation layout. The grid layout is based on a grid that defines cells in which
dialog object can take place. The tabulation layout is based on tabulations to which
dialog objects are attached by one ore several sides. The grid layout is a bit easier to
understand and implement than the tabulation layout, but provides less capabilities. It
match most of the situations and is the recommended way of arranging dialog objects.</p>

<h3><a name="200000"></a>Object and Container Sizes</h3>

<p>The size of each object is determined by its contents. For example, a label, that is a
CATDlgLabel instance, size is determined at instantiation time using the text it contains
and the character font used to display the text. If your change the text or the character
font or both, when reinstantiating the label, its size changes accordingly. But if you
dynamically change the text by means of the method <code>SetTitle</code> without
reinstantiating the label, the size does not change and maybe a part of the text is not
displayed. </p>

<p>The size of a container is also determined by its contents. The size of a
CATDlgTabContainer instance is the size of the biggest CATDlgTab instance it contains. </p>

<p>The CATDlgContainer is an exception. Since it is dedicated to contain many controls,
but usually to display only a part of them, you need to assign it a size using absolute
values expressed in pixels by means of the <code>SetRectDimensions</code> method. For
example, the following statement </p>

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td><pre>pContainer-&gt;SetRectDimensions(1, 1, 200, 300);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>sets the size of <code>pWindow1</code> to 200 pixels width and 300 pixels height. The
two first coordinates are unused, but must be positive (&gt;0). </p>

<p>You can also set its size in order to show all its content, as follows:</p>

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td><pre>pContainer-&gt;SetRectDimensions(1, 1, -1, -1);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="300000"></a>Dynamic Resizing or Modification</h3>

<p>When resizing a dialog window, the containers it contains are resized accordingly, and
part of&nbsp; their contents can be modified or hidden. For example, containers or
subcontainers whose sizes decrease can hide controls and scrollbars can appear to help
display hidden controls. On the opposite, when increasing the dialog window size, the
scrollbars can disappear as soon as all the existing controls are displayed.</p>

<p>But when the dialog window is displayed, it is expected to keep the same contents,
whether this contents being fully displayed or partly hidden, in order to display
consistently to the end user. Nevertheless, two exceptions exist: 

<ol>
  <li>Two or several objects can be designed to be displayed at the same location, depending
    on the context. In this case, all these objects must be created when building the dialog
    window. The appropriate one is then displayed and attached to the tabulation line when
    necessary, the one previously displayed is concurrently detached and hidden. This is
    possible using tabulations only with the ReplaceKeepAttachments method</li>
  <li>A dialog box can have a hidden part that can be displayed using a More push button. This
    is possible with CATDlgDialog derived classes that feature the CATDlgWndAutoResize style,
    and that contains only CATDlgFrame instances.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="400000"></a>Grid Layout</h3>

<p><strong>This is the recommended way of arranging dialog objects</strong>. It uses a
grid made of cells. Each cell is located at the intersection of a row and a column. A
given container or dialog object is contained in one or more cells, and can be attached to
cell sides for resizing management. Each container has its own grid used for the layout of
the objects it contains. This is described in &quot;Arranging Dialog Objects Using Grid&quot;
[<a href="#References">2</a>]</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="500000"></a>Tabulation Layout</h3>

<p>This is not the recommended way of arranging dialog objects but it is
sometimes necessary to create dynamic layout. It uses a
set of horizontal and vertical tabulation lines along which you can attach the sides of
the containers and objects. You can&nbsp;have a set of horizontal and vertical tabulation line
set for each container to manage the layout of the objects it contains. This is described
in &quot;Arranging Dialog Objects Using Tabulations&quot; [<a href="#References">3</a>]</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>

<p>Dialog object container sizes are determined using their contents. Containers can be
resized without modifying their contents, that can be partially hidden if necessary.
Containers and controls can be arranged either using a grid (recommended), or using
tabulations (Not recommended). </p>

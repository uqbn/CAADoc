      <p>Arranging dialog objects in a dialog window, a dialog box, a frame or a
      tab page, that is a container, consists in positionning each object at a
      given place with respect to the others [<a href="#References">1</a>]. The
      container layout will then not changed when the dialog window is resized.
      The dialog objects can be precisely arranged in their respective
      containers using a grid attached to the container.

<h3><a name="400000"></a>What Is Dialog Object Grid Layout?</h3>
<p>The grid layout consists in designing a grid made of cells located at the
intersection of rows and columns. A cell is defined using the intersecting row
and column numbers. Each dialog object occupies a rectangular space spread in
one or several cells. It's location is defined using the cell at its top left
corner, and using the number of cells in which it horizontally and vertically
spreads.</p>
<p>This enables the container sizes to be defined by their contents. A given row
has the width of the wider object it contains, and a column has the height of
its higher object. A given object that spreads in several cells can have more
room that it really needs. To overcome this, the object can define the way it is
attached to the cell sides.</p>
<p>The grid layout applies to CATDlgDocument, CATDlgDialog, CATDlgFrame, and
CATDlgTabPage objects.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="500000"></a>A Grid Layout Example</h3>
<p>Assume you need to create the following window, as a class that derives from
CATDlgDialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayoutWindow.jpg" alt="CATDlgGridLayoutWindow.jpg (13714 bytes)" width="286" height="199"></p>
<p>It contains a spinner and two check buttons aligned on the first row, then a
combo alone on the second row, and three push buttons aligned on the third row.
The OK, Cancel, and Help push buttons are supplied with the CATDlgDialog derived
class and are not to be arranged in the window. The window constructor must be
as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>GridLayoutWindow ::GridLayoutWindow (CATDialog * Parent,
                                     const CATString&amp; Name,
		           	     CATDlgStyle Style)
                 : CATDlgDialog(Parent, Name, Style)
{}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>And the object that instantiate it must use the CATDlgGridLayout style as
follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>GridLayoutWindow * pWindow = new GridLayoutWindow (this,
                                                   &quot;GridWind&quot;,
                                                   <strong>CATDlgGridLayout</strong>);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The grid to build is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayout.gif" alt="CATDlgGridLayout.gif (25066 bytes)" width="494" height="510"></p>
<p>The grid could be built using the SetGridConstraints method. It is used on
each control to associate with it the positioning parameters, as the five
arguments of SetGridConstraints:
<ol>
  <li>The row number where the control top left corner is located in</li>
  <li>The column number where the control top left corner is located in</li>
  <li>The number of rows on which the control is spread</li>
  <li>The number of columns on which the control is spread</li>
  <li>The attachment mode. It can be set to <code>CATGRID_LEFT</code>, <code>CATGRID_RIGHT</code>,
    <code>CATGRID_TOP</code>, <code>CATGRID_BOTTOM</code>, and <code>CATGRID_4SIDES</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Rows and column numbers begin with 0. You can see that the combo top left
corner is located in the cell at the intersection of the row 1 and column 0, and
spreads on three rows and one column. Since it is attached by the four sides, it
occupies the full space, even if the size is increased. The set of calls to
SetGridConstraints that build the first window displayed is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>Spinner-&gt;SetGridConstraints(0,0,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
CB1    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(0,1,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
CB2    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(0,2,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
Combo  -&gt;SetGridConstraints(1,0,3,1,CATGRID_4SIDES);
PB1    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(2,0,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
PB2    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(2,1,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
PB3    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(2,3,1,1,CATGRID_RIGHT);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The same window is shown with three other attachment modes applied to the
combo:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayoutWindowLeft.jpg" alt="CATDlgGridLayoutWindowLeft.jpg (12827 bytes)" width="286" height="199"></td>
    <td><code>CATGRID_LEFT</code>: The combo is attached by its left side. Even
      if it doesn't seem to be spread on three cells, no other control can
      occupy this area.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayoutWindowCenter.jpg" alt="CATDlgGridLayoutWindowCenter.jpg (12959 bytes)" width="286" height="199"></td>
    <td><code>CATGRID_CENTER</code>: The combo is attached at the center of its
      area.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayoutWindowRight.jpg" alt="CATDlgGridLayoutWindowRight.jpg (13015 bytes)" width="286" height="199"></td>
    <td><code>CATGRID_RIGHT</code>: The combo is attached by its right side. The
      space in front of it is empty, but if longer character strings were used
      for its lines, its size could grow to the left.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Since the combo is allone on its row, its size determines the row height, and
the two other attachment modes, that is&nbsp; <code>CATGRID_TOP</code> and <code>CATGRID_BOTTOM</code>,
would have the same effect than <code>CATGRID_LEFT</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="600000"></a>The Grid Layout Toolbox</h3>
<p>To use the grid layout, you need to do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Creating a CATDlgGridConstraints instance and assigning it to a dialog
    object</li>
  <li>Understanding how to attach a dialog object with respect to the cell sides</li>
  <li>Enabling rows and colums for resize.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<h4>Creating a CATDlgGridConstraints Instance and Assigning it to Dialog Objects</h4>
<p>The grid is not an object itself. You only need to define how each object is
located in the grid using one or several CATDlgGridConstraints instances, and
the grid is interpreted from these instances. As we see in the example, you can
use the SetGridConstraints method on each object you want to arrange, either
when this object is a control, or when it is a container contained in another
container, such as a frame contained in another frame. The grid you refer to is
set to the containment parent [<a href="#References">2</a>] of the dialog
object, and must be consistently reffered to for any object having this
containment parent. SetGridConstraints assigns to the object it applies an
instance of the CATDlgGridConstraints class that holds the positionning
parameters. You could do this in two ways:
<ol>
  <li>Use the SetGridConstraints methods with five arguments as shown in the
    example. This method creates the CATDlgGridConstraints class instance and
    assigns it to the container or control</li>
  <li>Create a CATDlgGridConstraints class instance, set and modify its
    parameters before assigning it using SetGridConstraints to each
    control,&nbsp; as follows:
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>CATDlgGridConstraints GridCst(0,0,1,1,CATGRID_LEFT);
Spinner-&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Column=1;
CB1    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Column=2;
CB2    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Row=1;
GridCst.Column=0;
GridCst.H_SPAN=3;
GridCst.V_SPAN=1;
GridCst.Justification=CATGRID_4SIDES;
Combo  -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Row=2;
GridCst.Column=0;
GridCst.H_SPAN=1;
GridCst.V_SPAN=1;
GridCst.Justification=CATGRID_LEFT;
PB1    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Column=1;
GridCst.Justification=CATGRID_BOTTOM;
PB2    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);
GridCst.Column=3;
GridCst.Justification=CATGRID_LEFT;
PB3    -&gt;SetGridConstraints(GridCst);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<h4>Understanding How to Attach a Dialog Object with Respect to the Cell Sides</h4>
<p>Attaching a dialog object to its cell(s) sides determines the dialog window
or container layout when the dialog winodw is first displayed with its original
size, and has also an effect when the end user resizes it. The following
attachment modes are available:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Attachment Mode</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_LEFT</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to the left side of the cell, or if the
      object spreads on several cells, to the left side of the left cell</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_RIGHT</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to the right side of the cell, or if
      the object spreads on several cells, to the right side of the right cell</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_TOP</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to the top side of the cell, or if the
      object spreads on several cells, to the top side of the top cell</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_BOTTOM</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to the bottom side of the cell, or if
      the object spreads on several cells, to the bottom side of the bottom cell</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_4SIDES</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to each of the four sides of the cell,
      or if the object spreads on several cells, to the left side of the left
      cell, to the right side of the right cell, to the top side of the top
      cell, and to the bottom side of the bottom cell. It is the concatenation
      of <code>CATGRID_LEFT</code>, <code>CATGRID_RIGHT</code>, <code>CATGRID_TOP</code>,
      and <code>CATGRID_BOTTOM</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_CST_WIDTH</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Keeps the object initial width when resizing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_CST_HEIGHT</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Keeps the object initial height when resizing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_CST_SIZE</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Keeps the object initial size, that is initial width and
      initial height, when resizing. It is the concatenation of <code>CATGRID_CST_WIDTH</code>
      and <code>CATGRID_CST_HEIGHT</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>CATGRID_CST_CENTER</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Attaches the object to each of the four sides of the cell,
      and keeps the object initial size, that is initial width and initial
      height, when resizing. It is the concatenation of <code>CATGRID_4SIDES</code>
      and <code>CATGRID_CST_SIZE</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>They can be concatenated using the &quot;|&quot; character, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>Combo-&gt;SetGridConstraints(1,0,3,1,CATGRID_LEFT<strong>|</strong>CATGRID_RIGHT);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The default value is <code>CATGRID_LEFT</code>|<code>CATGRID_TOP</code>.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4>Enabling Rows and Columns for Resize</h4>
<p>You can also manage the ability of a given row or column to be resized when
its container is itself resized. The grid rows and columns are by default non
sensitive to resizing. Resizing occurs in two cases:
<ol>
  <li>The end user resizes the whole dialog box or window. This is possible if
    the dialog box or window isn't set to CATDlgWndNoResize</li>
  <li>The dialog box or window is being constructed, and the different
    containers and controls must match their container size according to their
    attachment mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>The height of a resizable row is increased or decreased when its container is
resized, while it is the width of a resizable column that changes. To set a row
or a column resizable, use the methods SetGridRowResizable and
SetGridColumnResizable.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>SetGridRowResizable(2,1);
SetGridColumnResizable(0,1);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The first argument is the row or column number in the grid. The second can be
set to 0 for a non resizable row or column, and to 1 for a resizable one. In the
example above, the third row and the first column are set as resizable.</p>
<p>When the containing window is resized, the controls or containers that are
spread in cells belonging to resizable rows or columns are moved or resized
according to their attachment mode. For example, the window of the example used
in this article is streched as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/CATDlgGridLayoutWindowResize.jpg" alt="CATDlgGridLayoutWindowResize.jpg (15412 bytes)" width="365" height="231"></p>
<p>The third row is resizable, as well as the first three columns. This is coded
as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>SetGridRowResizable(2,1);
SetGridColumnResizable(0,1);
SetGridColumnResizable(1,1);
SetGridColumnResizable(2,1);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that the spinners and the check buttons were explicitly attached to
their cell left side. Their cells are stretched, and empty space appears to
their rights. The combo were attached to the four sides of the cells, and is
stretched to occupy the full width of the three cells. These first two lines
have kept their initial height, since they are not resizable. The third row is
stretched. Its height increases. Apply and Restore have not moved vertically,
because they are attached to their cell top side, but Undo, which is attached to
its cell bottom side, has moved vertically. This shows the new row height. As
for the first row, the first three columns are stretched, but the fourth, which
contains Restore, is not resizable and its width&nbsp; has not changed.</p>

<h3><a name="700000"></a>The Object Container Grid Layout Specific
ProgrammingTasks</h3>
<p>To manage the layout of a container using a grid, you can use the following
methods. They apply to:
<ul>
  <li><a href="../CAADlgQuickRefs/CAADlgCATDlgFrame.htm">Frames</a>,
    instances of the CATDlgFrame instances</li>
  <li><a href="../CAADlgQuickRefs/CAADlgCATDlgTabPage.htm">Tab pages</a>
    or property pages, instances of the CATDlgTabPage instances</li>
  <li>Your classes that derive from <a href="../CAADlgQuickRefs/CAADlgCATDlgDocument.htm">CATDlgDocument</a>
    or <a href="../CAADlgQuickRefs/CAADlgCATDlgDialog.htm">CATDlgDialog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Layout using a grid is available only if the CATDlgGridLayout style is used
in the object constructor. The available methods enable to set a row or a column
of the grid as resizable, and to ask if a row or a column is resizable. The
examples use a CATDlgFrame instance:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Set 1st row as resizable</td>
    <td class="code">
      <pre>int RowIndex = 0;        // First row
int Resizability = 1;    // 0 means non resizable
pFrame-&gt;<strong>SetGridRowResizable</strong>(RowIndex, Resizability);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Set 3rd column as resizable</td>
    <td class="code">
      <pre>int ColumnIndex = 2;     // Third column
Resizability = 1;        // 0 means non resizable
pFrame-&gt;<strong>SetGridColumnResizable</strong>(ColumnIndex, Resizability);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ask if 4th row is resizable</td>
    <td class="code">
      <pre>RowIndex = 3;            // Fourth row
Resizability = pFrame-&gt;<strong>IsGridRowResizable</strong>(RowIndex);
if (Resizability == 1)
  ... // Row is resizable
else  // Resizability == 0
  ... // Row is NOT resizable</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ask if 6th column is resizable</td>
    <td class="code">
      <pre>ColumnIndex = 5;         // Sixth column
Resizability = pFrame-&gt;<strong>IsGridColumnResizable</strong>(ColumnIndex);
if (Resizability == 1)
  ... // Column is resizable
else  // Resizability == 0
  ... // Column is NOT resizable</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>Dialog object container sizes are determined using their contents. Containers
can be resized without modifying their contents, that can be partially hidden if
necessary. They are arranged according to a grid made of cells that are
determined by the intersection of rows and columns. Containers and controls can
occupy one cell, or can be spread in several ones. They can be attached to some
or all of their cell sides, and can be requested to keep the same width or
height when the dialog window is resized. Rows and columns are by default
non-resizable, but can be explicitly set as resizable. Container and control
location and size after resizing depend on their attachment mode.</p>

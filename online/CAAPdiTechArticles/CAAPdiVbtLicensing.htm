     <h3>Abstract</h3>
     <p>This article describes the basic operations to set up your licensing 
     configuration for the RADE development environment. Each user needs to 
     explicitly specify which licenses he will acquire when launching any of the 
     tools provided within the RADE offering.</p>
     <p>You will learn how to customize your environment to tell which license 
     you wish to acquire, how to modify these settings, how to use the 
     interactive product allowing you to do this.</p>

 <h3><a name="How_licences_work"></a>What You Need to Understand About the 
 Licenses</h3>
 <p>Whenever you launch a RADE product, a set of licenses is acquired during the 
 execution of that product. This set of licenses is explicitly chosen by the 
 user, and each user is responsible for acquiring the correct license to allow 
 his product to run. You will not be able to work with any of the RADE products 
 until you have first reserved the corresponding licenses. Licenses come in two 
 flavors: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Configuration licenses</li>
   <li>Configuration plus add-on license.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Products belong to one or several different configurations. By acquiring a 
 configuration license, you enable all the products within that configuration to 
 run. Some products are also available as add-ons on existing configurations. 
 The configuration plus add-on license enable all the products of the 
 configuration plus the products declared as add-ons to run.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

 <h3><a name="How_to_reserve_your_licences"></a>How to Reserve Licenses for Your 
 Products</h3>
 <p>The licenses you wish to acquire for a specific product are stored in a 
 setting file. You inform the setting file by using the &quot; <font color="#008000">
 RADE Tools Licensing</font>&quot; interactive application. This application consists 
 of a single panel as shown in the image below: </p>
 <p>
 <img border="0" src="images/CAAPdiRADEInstallLicense1.png" width="697" height="636"></p>
 <p>This window is divided into three parts:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>The upper part of the window displays information relative to your 
   computer and licensing server:
   <ul>
     <li><b>Target Id</b>: specifies the target id of your computer</li>
     <li><b>Display Type</b>: informs you whether you are running on a local or 
     remote display:
     <ul>
       <li>Local: you are running on a local display and you are working with 
       nodelocked or server licenses</li>
       <li>Remote: you are running on a remote display and you are working with 
       server licenses</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Active servers</b>: if you are using network licensing, the list of 
     all active and available license servers is displayed<br>
     If you are using nodelocked license, <b>Active servers</b> is set to &quot;None&quot;.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li>The left-hand part shows you the various products available within RADE</li>
   <li>The right-hand part shows you the licenses available on the licensing 
   server or in the nodelock file, cross-referenced with what you have installed 
   on your computer.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>The License Manager allows you to reserve the same licenses for all the 
 products available on the RADE CD, or to individualize the licenses reserved 
 for one particular product of the RADE CD.</p>
 <p>The &quot;+&quot; button is displayed next to the license in the list. Clicking this 
 button lets you switch between compact mode (the default) and expanded mode. In 
 compact mode, the license imported is already reserved. Click the &quot;+&quot; button to 
 switch to expanded mode. In this mode, a sub-list is displayed containing the 
 list of all the installed licenses, preceded by the Any License option.</p>
 <p>A list of licenses may exist, for example, when you have several identical 
 configuration licenses with different serial numbers. This can be the case, for 
 example, when licenses are served by different servers or in the nodelock file, 
 or set up for use by different groups.</p>
 <p>Your administrator may instruct you to reserve a specific license in the 
 list.</p>
 <p>If not, just click the <b>Any License</b> option, which means that you 
 consider any of the licenses in the list to be sufficient for your needs.</p>
 <p>The status <b>No License</b> appears next to configurations which have been 
 installed, but for which you do not have a license. The configuration name is 
 grayed out in the list, and the check button cannot be checked.</p>
 <p>The status <b>Available</b> appears next to configurations which have been 
 installed and for which you have a valid license.</p>
 <p>Check the check buttons for the configurations for which you want to reserve 
 a license. </p>
 <p>After checking the licenses you wish to reserve, press the <b>Apply</b> 
 button and exit the licensing manager. You need to restart a product 
 after reserving configuration licenses.</p>
 <p>Licensing settings are stored in a settings file named RADELicensing.xml. 
 For the RADE tools, the location of this setting file can be parameterized with 
 the environment variable <b>RADECATSettingPath</b>. A default value is provided 
 should this variable not be set. Remember that if you wish to use this 
 variable, then it must be active when you start the License Manager Tool, as 
 well as when you start the RADE tool for which the License settings are set.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
 <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h3><a name="How_to_start_the_manager"></a>How to Start the Licensing Manager</h3>
 <p>You can start the licensing manager tool by running the following command:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><b>On Windows</b>: 
   $RADE_INSTALLATION_PATH$/$OS$/code/bin/CATVBTLicenser.exe</li>
   <li><b>On UNIX</b>: catstart -run CATVBTLicenser in 
   $RADE_INSTALLATION_PATH$/$OS$/code/command</li>
 </ul>
 <p>where:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><b>RADE_INSTALLATION_PATH</b> is the location where you installed the 
   RADE CD.</li>
   <li><b>OS</b> is the operating system tag (eg. intel_a, aix_a,  
	etc.).</li>
 </ul>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
  <!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
 <h3><a name="LicenseExpiry"></a>License Expiry Date Warnings</h3>
 <p>The Alert control in RADE Tools Licensing (CATVBTLicenser) enables you to be informed
 by a message (popup for interactive applications and written in logs for batch 
 applications) that a license will soon expire.</p>
 <p>Information about license expiry dates is already available via the
 Nodelock Key Management tool which lists nodelock licenses and the 
 remaining validity duration using a color code:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Green means more than 30 days before expiration</li>
   <li>Orange means less than 30 days before expiration</li>
   <li>Red means already expired.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Regarding concurrent licenses, LUM tools allow the administrator to manage 
 licenses and in particular to determine license expiry dates.</p>
 <p>But neither method provides end users with advanced warnings of imminent 
 license expiry.</p>
 <p>The <b>Alert</b> control lets you set the number of days before the license 
	expiration from which the expiry message will be issued.</p>
 <p>
 <img border="0" src="images/CAAPdiRADEInstallLicense3.gif" width="697" height="150"></p>
 <p>It is set by default to 30 days, and is enabled by default. You can change the 
 number of days, as shown above. This means that if a 
 granted license is going to expire within the entered number of days, 
 a message or a warning popup will be displayed.</p>
 <p>The message or the warning popup is displayed as soon as a license is granted.
 This means that the message will appear each time you start a batch command (such 
 as mkmk from MAB,
 mkodt from CUT, mkCheckSource from CSC, adl_ls_co from SCM or mkmancpp from CDG), open a V5 workspace 
 or use a command requesting a new license using the dashboards (IRAD6, Visual .NET, SCM gui).</p>
 <p>Note that:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The maximum value you can set is 90 days</li>
   <li>If you do not want to be warned by a popup when acquiring a license, set 
   the value to 0 to disable the alert</li>
   <li>The tooltip message displayed when pointing at the control indicates that the 
   value is between 0 and 90 days.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The alert is available only for nodelock (and consequently offline) 
 licenses.</p>
 <p>If more than one license is about to expire, the popup will display a 
 message like this:</p>
 <p><code>The following granted license(s) will soon expire:<br>
 CDC (2118..R1) in 10 days<br>
 DMC (2126..R1) in less than 24 hours<br>
 (Launch CATVBTLicenser and enter 0 for Alert value if you no 
 longer wish to display this message)</code></p>

 <h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>You cannot start any of the RADE tools before defining the licenses you 
   wish to reserve for that tool.</li>
   <li>The &quot;RADE Tools Licensing&quot; application allows you to define the licenses 
   you wish to reserve</li>
   <li>You can manage the period of time during which warnings are issued when licenses are near to expire.</li>
 </ul>

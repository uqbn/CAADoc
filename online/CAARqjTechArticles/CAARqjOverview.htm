      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Like for development tasks, tests activities can take place in your
      environment that provides an infrastructure for writing, delivering, and
      running test programs associated with CAA V5 frameworks. This article
      explains the structure of the test frameworks and how to write test
      programs, and what are the interests of delivering them in the CAA V5 file
      tree.</p>

<h3><a name="Why"></a>Why Should You Use the CAA V5 Test Infrastructure?</h3>
<p>CAA V5 supplies an infrastructure to test your frameworks and applications.
This infrastructure is fully integrated in the development environment you use
to develop your frameworks and applications and takes advantage of the same
tools and mechanisms. In addition, it allows you to automate the test program
execution.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Frameworks"></a>Tests Are Related to Frameworks</h4>
<p>Test programs are written for a specific purpose (i.e. test a specific
program!). As a consequence it seems to be obvious that they should be related
to, and delivered with the application frameworks they are intended to test.
This the CAA V5 file tree provides <strong>test frameworks</strong> that can
contain any kind of programs and that contains, as any framework, an
IdentityCard file specifying the tested application frameworks.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Tests"></a>Tests Can Be Developed and Shared As Well As Programs</h4>
<p>Test programs can be as complex as any program, thus the same problems can be
encountered: concurrent engineering, parallel development, and so on. Using the
test framework, developers can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build test programs: the software architecture which is supported for CAA
    V5 programs is available for test programs as well. You can then use the
    generic code builder mkmk [<a href="#References">1</a>] and structure your
    programs using modules
  <li>Exchange: any user is able to create and to deliver a test framework.
    Conversely, any user can get a copy of an existing test framework, parallel
    developments and concurrent engineering are allowed like for application
    frameworks
  <li>Run everywhere: using predefined variables, observing some rules and
    delivering test programs in test frameworks, you are able to execute them
    from any workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Predefined"></a>A Predefined Environment Eases the Development of
Test Programs</h4>
<p>There are often two problems to address when developing test programs: on one
hand, you must think of the way you'll test your application, and on the other
hand you must set up the runtime environment and automate these tests. This
second aspect has been studied and some solutions can be brought in the CAA V5
scope:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tests are run by a particular command named mkodt [<a href="#References">2</a>]
    that sets up the runtime environment both for CAA V5 applications and for
    the test programs themselves
  <li>Predefined directories and environment variables are available for test
    programs to find external resources, such as input data, reference output,
    and the like
  <li>The CAA V5 infrastructure can be used whether tests are run on Unix or
    Windows platforms. This is possible thanks to specific predefined variables
    that are independent from the operating systems [<a href="#References">2</a>]
    and by following some basic rules [<a href="#References">3</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Auto"></a>Tests Can Be Run Automatically</h4>
<p>The fact that test frameworks can be delivered along with application
frameworks and that their test programs can be run automatically allow the
automation of some test based certifications before code delivery. You will also
see that CAA V5 provides a way to record sequences of user interactions in order
to replay them afterwards.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="How to"></a>How to Write Test Programs</h3>
<p>The basis of CAA V5 tests is composed of programs that use the interfaces and
classes exported by the application frameworks, and shells that are containers
for those programs. Shells are used as containers because they can be run with
Unix, and withWindows since the <em>Korn Shell</em> is a prerequisite for CAA V5
tools. Test programs and shells are delivered in test frameworks.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="TestFramework"></a>What Is a Test Framework?</h4>
<p>The test framework is one of the three types of CAA V5 frameworks, it
provides a predefined structure to store both test programs and related data. A
test framework is composed of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The framework name: it usually is the same as the associated application
    framework but with <strong>.tst</strong> as suffix.
  <li>The Identity Card: it contains references to application frameworks which
    are prerequisites for test programs - as these programs are supposed to test
    a specific application framework, this framework should be one of those
    references.
  <li>Modules: like in application frameworks, a test framework may contain
    modules which correspond to test programs. Note also that usual interface
    directories are available in test framework (<em>fw/PublicInterfaces</em>, <em>fw/ProtectedInterfaces</em>,
    <em>fw/mod.m/LocalInterfaces</em>, ...).
  <li>FunctionTests: a specific data module exists in which program container as
    well as test related data should be stored in (see next figure).</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CAARqjTestFileTree.jpg" width="960" height="720"></p>
<p>The <em>FunctionTests</em> directory contains predefined directories but,
inside them, the user is free to create his/her own structure of files and
directories. Here are these directories and what should be stored/find in each
of them:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CAARqjWSFunctionTests.jpg" width="376" height="184"></p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">TestCases</td>
    <td>This is the directory where shells must be stored. Shells bear <strong>.sh</strong>
      as suffix and their purpose is to firstly set up some test specific
      environment variables, secondly to run the program and finally to return
      an appropriate error code regarding the program return code and outputs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">InputData
    <td>You can store in it any data that could be used as input for your
      programs. There is no particular suffix defined for those data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Output
    <td>This directory is the repository of all outputs and data that are
      produced during test program execution. For instance, if a program
      generates a file, this should be generated in this directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">OutputRef</td>
    <td>This directory is used to store any &quot;reference&quot; data which
      allows shells to compare what is produced by programs (output messages,
      files, and so on) with what should be produced (if they worked!). For
      example, if you want to test a program which automate some modifications
      on a CATIA model, you can first perform these modifications &quot;by
      hand&quot; and save the result in a file you store in the OutputRef
      directory, then make a comparison (in the shell) between this model and
      the one produced by the test program in the Output/$OS directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">SwitchTestCases</td>
    <td>This is the directory where switch test program shells are stored. These
      test programs are used to decide whether to switch the current level
      without replaying all the test objects. They should be representative of
      the framework</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">TestCases</td>
    <td>This is the directory where common test programs shells are stored.
      Shells bear <strong>.sh</strong> as suffix and their purpose is to firstly
      set up some test specific environment variables, secondly to run the
      program and finally to return an appropriate error code regarding the
      program return code and output.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The next section shows you the way to reference these directories and to
write portable shells.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="ExternalData"></a>Referencing External Data</h4>
<p>Shell variables are automatically set according to the current test
environment (i.e., the workspace from where the tests are run). You can use them
to access your data whatever the absolute path to them may be [<a href="#References">2</a>].</p>

<h4><a name="Samples"></a>Basic Shell Samples</h4>
<p>The minimum that can be written.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EOEOEO" width="40%">
      <pre>#------</pre>
      <pre>SetOdtParam TYPE=JAVABATCH</pre>
      <pre>
#-----</pre>
      <pre>
JavaReplay MyApplet
exit $rc</pre>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="60%">&nbsp;Let's detail it:
      <ul>
        <li>The first line is a comment (starts with '#').
        <li>The next line tells that this ODT is a Java ODT
        <li>The line containing the JavaReplay command will launch the applet <b><i>MyApplet&nbsp;</i></b>
        <li>If the program fails, the shell exits directly using the JavaReplay
          return code as error code. Otherwise, additional checking may be
          performed.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to these samples, some rules can help to write shells which can
be executed on both Unix and Windows platforms [<a href="#References">3</a>].</p>

<h3><a name="How"></a>How to Run Tests</h3>
<p>As mentioned in previous sections, tests are not directly executed by the
user but their execution is controlled by a particular command: <strong>mkodt. </strong>Its
purpose is to prepare the test environment by setting variables needed at
runtime according to the local user environment. It is available with
&quot;mkmk&quot; commands.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Inside"></a>Inside a Workspace</h4>
<p>Tests always take place in a workspace and are used to check what is
developed in this workspace, thus only programs and shared libraries that are
visible in a workspace can be tested by test objects in this workspace. However,
note that the concatenation feature brings visibility on data managed among
multiple workspaces.</p>
<p>Any test can be run either being under a workspace - the current working
directory is under the workspace root directory - or by referencing a workspace.
Both modes are specified through mkodt options [<a href="#References">2</a>].
One test object or all test objects can be run at user's convenience.</p>
<p>We'd just like to give you an idea on how you can put in place some automatic
tests in order to certify the quality of your software. Here is an example of an
organization where several people are working on the same software, each of them
owning a workspace from which he/she delivers pieces of software. Regarding the
workspace hierarchy, we can see that all modifications must go through the <em>project</em>
workspace. This <em>project</em> workspace is a place where automatic tests
should be run each time there are some new modifications to promote outside the
scope of this organization.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Control"></a>Controlling Test Execution</h4>
<p>A shell can include specific commands to control some aspects of its
execution. These commands are:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><code>ODTInit</code> [<a href="#References">4</a>]</td>
    <td>Runs an initialization shell script</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SetOdtParam</code> [<a href="#References">5</a>]</td>
    <td>Sets ODT parameter values</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>WhichDir</code> [<a href="#References">6</a>]</td>
    <td>Finds a directory or a file in a workspace</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<p>A shell for a java ODT must include specific command to be launched on every
JRE. This command is:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><code>JavaReplay</code> [<a href="#References">7</a>]</td>
    <td>Runs the applet or the java application without taking care of the java
      environment</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<hr>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>Like program source files are managed in application frameworks, the test
framework provides a predefined organization of files and directories (modules, <em>FunctionTests</em>,
etc.) in which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test applications can be delivered and built using mkmk.
  <li>Any useful data can be stored and used at runtime.
  <li>A test object consists of at least one shell script which can call either
    a specific java test program.
  <li>Predefined variables are provided to get test objects that can be run on
    any supported operating system (Unix, Windows).
  <li>The runtime environment is automatically set by the mkodt command in order
    to be able to run the java application with the given JRE.</li>
</ul>

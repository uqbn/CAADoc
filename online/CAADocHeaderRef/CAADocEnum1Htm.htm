   As soon as the command is selected, the command selector
   deactivates the previous active command, that is, withdraws
   the focus and puts it into the command stack from where it can be
   reactivated later on,
   and gives the focus to the selected command to make
   it the active one.

   deletes the previous active command
   and gives the focus to the selected command to make

/**
 * Class to use for language meaningful character strings.
 * &lt;b&gt;Role&lt;/b&gt;:
 * CATUnicodeString must be used whenever a character string is
 * needed, and that is either seen, entered, or manipulated by the 
 * end user. In this way, the client application is shielded from 
 * implementation details regarding language, locale, bytecoding
 * of characters, and so forth. Client applications thus become portable
 * since they can handle character strings expressed in any language.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For other character strings, not seen by the user but internally
 * manipulated by the client application, the CATString class
 * is required, instead of the raw type char
 * you should never use.
 *

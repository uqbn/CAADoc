<h3><a name="CAAResources"></a>CAA Authorized APIs</h3>
<p>V5 configurations and products may include Authorized APIs that can be used
to create client applications. The APIs authorized by a configuration or a
product are located in the PublicInterfaces 
directories of one or several frameworks of the configuration or the product.
Additional APIs may be found in these directories, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To close the set of Authorized APIs with some DS Internal Resources from
    the <code>#include</code> statement standpoint</li>
  <li>To enable code generated by different tools to build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client applications can use only CAA Authorized APIs tagged using CAA
Authorized API qualifiers. These qualifiers help to distinguish them from the
others supplied only for build purpose. In addition, some Authorized APIs, such
as classes or interfaces, may be only partially authorized. For example, a class
may authorize only a subset of its methods. As a CAA developer, to know what you
can use, you can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refer to the CAA Authorized API reference part of the CAA Encyclopedia:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('CPP');return false;">C++ API</a>
        reference</li>
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('IDL');return false;">Automation
        API</a> reference</li>
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('Java');return false;">Java
        API</a> reference</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Refer to the C++ or IDL header files, and interpret the CAA Authorized API
    qualifiers and tags, as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that what is <b>NOT</b> documented in the CAA Encyclopedia is a DS
Internal Resource and <b>CANNOT</b> be used in a client application.</p>
<p>Java APIs do not include CAA Authorized API qualifiers. Only documented Java
APIs are authorized and can be used.</p>

    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>U4</b></td>
    <td><b>Interface</b>: can be re-implemented with a DS adapter. C++ usage<br>
      The common usage is to implement this interface onto a client component,
      usually in an C++ extension class, by deriving the DS adapter, that is,
      the class provided by DS to be derived for this purpose. This class has a
      U2 usage, and provides the interface method implementations. Only a subset
      of the interface methods needs to be implemented, the remainder being
      implemented by the DS adapter. Usually, only the methods to implement are
      documented.
      <p>U4 usage is followed by the adapter to use. For example, the <i>CATIEdit</i>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>U6</b></td>
    <td><b>Interface</b>: must be derived. C++ usage<br>
      The common usage is to create an interface that derives from this
      interface without adding new methods, and to implement the derived
      interface. This is for example the case of a workbench or add-in exposed
      interface.</td>

<h3><a name="CAAResourceDeprecation"></a>CAA Authorized API Deprecation</h3>
<p>When a CAA Authorized API becomes obsolete, it is deprecated. Although this
should be exceptional, the number of the CAA Authorized API makes it happen more
frequently than wished. The deprecation process runs as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deprecation takes place for C++, Automation, and Java APIs</li>
  <li>A deprecated API can be any Authorized API (class, interface, method,
    global function, enum, structure, #define or macro, and so on)</li>
  <li>An Authorized API is deprecated starting from the General Availability
    (GA) of a new V5 release, and never starting from a Service Pack (SP)</li>
  <li>A deprecated API remains available during a two-release life time starting
    from the one for which it is deprecated.<br>
    Starting with V5-6R2012 a release can be identified by its marketing name, eg: V5-6R2012,
    or its code level, eg: V5R22. Correspondence between marketing names and code levels
    is described <a href=#CAAReleases>here</a>. In the following we'll use the code level
    that offers an easier understanding of the sequence order of the releases.
    For example, an Authorized API deprecated starting from V5R11 will remain
    available without modification during the whole V5R11 and V5R12 life times.</li>
  <li>A deprecated API shows its replacing Authorized API that client
    applications must use instead. This replacing Authorized API is of course
    available at the deprecation time. The two-release life time is dedicated to
    CAA developers to modify their client applications using the replacing
    Authorized API. Deprecated APIs are available from the CAA Encyclopedia that
    includes a deprecated index for each API language:
    <ul class="intable">
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('CPP', 'Deprecated');return false;">CAA
        C++ API Deprecated Index</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('IDL', 'Deprecated');return false;">CAA
        IDL API Deprecated Index</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="#" onclick="javascript:link('Java', 'Deprecated');return false;">CAA
        Java API Deprecated Index</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A deprecated API issues a warning when client application modules that
    contain it are rebuilt</li>
  <li>A deprecated API is removed from the CAA Authorized APIs two releases
    after the one it was deprecated.<br>
    For example, an API deprecated starting from V5R11 will be removed on V5R13
    GA.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="CAAResourceStability"></a>CAA Authorized API Stability</h3>
<p>Client application compatibility depends on CAA Authorized API stability
between SPs and releases.</p>
<p>CAA Authorized APIs are checked in a such a way that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are run time compatible between the Service Packs (SPs) of a given V5
    release.<br>
    This means that client applications don't need to be rebuilt on SPs.</li>
  <li>They are build time compatible between two subsequent V5 releases, as far
    as the deprecation process doesn't take place.<br>
    This means that client applications must be rebuilt on new V5 releases
    without code changes, except if Authorized APIs tagged as deprecated are
    used in the client application and if it was deprecated from more than two
    releases. Warning are issued when rebuilding the application for each
    deprecated API found. See <a href="#CAAResourceDeprecation">CAA Deprecation</a>.
</ul>
<p>Run time compatible possible modifications between two successive SPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add new classes and interfaces</li>
  <li>For U1 &quot;Use as is&quot; classes: add new concrete public methods</li>
  <li>For U2 &quot;may be derived&quot; classes: add new concrete, public or
    protected methods</li>
  <li>For both U1 and U2 classes: add, modify, or remove concrete private
    methods</li>
  <li>For interfaces: nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>Build time compatible possible modifications between two successive releases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Same as above PLUS:</li>
  <li>Declare classes / interfaces / methods as deprecated provided that the
    function is replaced with another one</li>
  <li>Remove or de-expose deprecated APIs after two releases.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="CAAResourceTags"></a>CAA Authorized APIs Additional Tags</h3>
<p>When scanning the header files, you may find two CAA tags in the comments
located above any entity, such as class, interface, enum, typedef, #define or
macro, or structure declaration, or global function or method prototype, that
locally resets for that entity the CAA Authorized API qualifiers set for the
header file. These two tags are:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <p align="center"><strong>Tag</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>@nodoc</b></td>
    <td><b>Do not use</b><br>
      This depicts a DS Internal Resource. Its usage is prohibited.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>@deprecated</b></td>
    <td><b>Do not use any longer</b><br>
      This means that the API was authorized, but will be removed. See <a href="#CAAResourceDeprecation">CAA
      Authorized API Deprecation</a>. The tag syntax is as follows:
      <pre>/**
 * @deprecated V5R11 CATBaseUnknown
 * ...</pre>
      <p>V5R11 means that the Authorized API is deprecated starting from V5R11,
      and that the replacing API is CATBaseUnknown. Its usage is prohibited
      starting with V5R13.</td>
  </tr>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="CAAResourceRequired"></a>CAA Authorized APIs Required by Your
Application</h3>
<p>The CAA Authorized APIs are supplied by configuration and&nbsp; products:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A run time configuration or product is protected by a license (MD2 for
    instance). This license authorizes parts of the V5 frameworks that make up
    the configuration or product. The CAA part of this configuration or product
    is made up of the sub-set of those frameworks containing at least a CAA V5
    Authorized API.
  <li>A CAA V5-based application or product intended to be compatible with a
    given run time license must be developed on top the previous sub-set.
  <li>This CAA V5-based application or product must be executed in an
    environment that exactly contains this run time license.</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine which CAA Authorized API are required by your application, go to
the <a href="#" onclick="javascript:linkUrl('http://www.caav5.com');return false">CAA
Internet site</a>. Register if you have not done it already, and go to the
Developer's C++ &amp; Java home page. Click CONFIGURATION CONTENTS in the left
frame, and select a V5 release, a media, and a configuration or a product to
know which frameworks it supplies.</p>

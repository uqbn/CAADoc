<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>This document defines a number of rules to follow while working with the
feature modeler. Following is a quick review of the concepts that are at the
base of the rules defined here.</p>
<p>The feature modeler is based on a prototype/instance model. As such, the
creation of new features in a document is initially based on the retrieval of a
prototype object called a StartUp. All StartUps must be created in catalogs in
order to be shareable between documents as well as for memory size and
performance reasons. Catalogs are protected by a client identifier that must be
known in order to access the catalog. At run-time, new features are created by
instantiating either StartUps from catalogs or by instantiating other features
already existing in the document.</p>
<p>A StartUp can be enriched with new behaviors and/or data in essentially two
ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The feature extension mechanism: allows the feature object to be extended
    at run-time with the data and behaviors of a feature extension object
    defined in a specific application context.</li>
  <li>The feature derivation mechanism: allows the feature object to inherit
    data and behaviors from other, previously defined feature objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>A StartUp can be created in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;from scratch&quot; - this is the case where the StartUp is entirely
    user-defined, i.e., it does not inherit any data or behaviors from other
    StartUps.</li>
  <li>simple derivation - this is the case where the StartUp derives from
    another StartUp found in one of the owner's catalogs.</li>
  <li>factory derivation - this is the case where the StartUp derives from
    another StartUp found in a catalog that does not belong to the same owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extension is created like a StartUp except that it can only derive from
another extension owned by the same user.</p>
<p>Here is a graphical illustration of the methods and mechanisms described
above:</p>
<p>Case 1: Create a StartUp &quot;from scratch&quot; and derive a new StartUp
from it.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="47%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAOsmFeatureRulesCase1.jpg" width="400" height="190"></td>
    <td width="53%">
      <p align="left">Client B creates a new StartUp &quot;from scratch&quot;
      with late type &quot;XXX&quot;. Client B then derives a new StartUp with
      late type &quot;YYY&quot; from &quot;XXX&quot;. Client B can perform this
      direct derivation because he is the owner of both.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Case 2: Create a new derived StartUp using a provided Factory.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAOsmFeatureRulesCase2.jpg" width="434" height="86"></td>
    <td width="50%">Client B creates a new StartUp with late type
      &quot;YYY&quot; deriving from the StartUp with late type &quot;XXX&quot;
      by using the provided factory. Since Client B is not the owner of the
      &quot;XXX&quot; late type, his only means of deriving a new StartUp from
      it is through the provided factory.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Case 3: Create a feature extension &quot;from scratch&quot; and use it to
extend a feature object. Create a derived feature extension.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="41%"><img border="0" src="images/CAAOsmFeatureRulesCase3.jpg" width="346" height="240"></td>
    <td width="59%">Client B activates a feature extension on a feature object.
      The feature object can be his own, Dassault Systemes' or Client A's.
      Client B can create a new feature extension by deriving one of his
      already-existing feature extensions.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="ExtVsDeriv"></a>Extension vs. Derivation</b></font></p>
<p>The feature extension mechanism allows a base feature to be enriched with
behaviors and data belonging to a feature extension that is activated at
run-time. It is used in the case where a base object has characteristics common
to several different applications. Using extensions, each application can take
into account its own specific needs while the base feature object remains stable
and unchanged.</p>
<p>The derivation mechanism alters the base feature by actually creating a new
feature late type having different data and behaviors.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that in the case of a derived StartUp, an
active application depends on the existence of API managing the derived/deriving
StartUp as well as on the existence of the catalogs containing the
derived/deriving StartUps. On the other hand, in the case of extensions, the
active application will tolerate the absence of an extension.</p>
<p>Between these two ways of enriching feature objects, choose the appropriate
one given the specific application needs and remember that the extension
mechanism should be favored whenever possible.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="Instantiation"></a>Instantiation</b></font></p>
<p>A feature object is instantiated in two possible types of containers: a
general applicative container or a Dassault Systemes container, depending on the
API used. In other words, if using the ObjectSpecsModeler API to manipulate
client-owned features in a specific client applicative context, the general
applicative container must be used. Otherwise, if using Dassault Systemes
specific API to manipulate features in a specific applicative context, the
container used will be a Dassault Systemes container.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="PubPriv"></a>&quot;Public&quot; and
&quot;Private&quot; features and attributes</b></font></p>
<p>A StartUp can be either &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot;. A
&quot;public&quot; StartUp means that its derivation is permitted by others. In
this case, the owner of the &quot;public&quot; StartUp must provide a factory
that will actually create the derived StartUp. The owner of the
&quot;public&quot; StartUp also provides specific API allowing the access and
manipulation of the features instantiated from it. A &quot;private&quot;
StartUp, on the other hand, remains hidden from others.</p>
<p>The attributes of a &quot;public&quot; StartUp also have a &quot;public&quot;
or &quot;private&quot; status defined at the time of their creation. A
&quot;public&quot; attribute can be accessible in read and/or write mode,
whereas a &quot;private&quot; attribute is not accessible at all.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="Compatibility"></a>Managing StartUp Compatibility</b></font></p>
<p>In order to ensure upward compability of feature data, specific rules must be
followed and applied when modifying StartUps and StartUp catalogs. These rules
are classified into 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rules for StartUp structure: moving and adding attributes on StartUps or
    from one StartUp to another</li>
  <li>rules for StartUp hierarchy: deleting StartUps in catalogs that may
    themselves be descendants or ascendants of other StartUps in the same or
    pre-requisite catalogs</li>
  <li>rules for StartUp catalogs: modifying catalog identity</li>
</ul>

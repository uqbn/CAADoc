<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The purpose we have is twofold in providing this refresh of the ergonomics
standards adapted to product lines applications:
<ul>
  <li>Give a measurement methodology and tools, based on the rules, in order to
    be able to rate the applications from an ergonomics perspective</li>
  <li>Give a comprehensive view of the principles and of the rules we have to
    follow, in order to help the development teams in designing their
    applications</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of caution though, this set of guidelines do not cover and do not
intend to cover the applicative concepts, how applications are divided and at
which granularity. These topics may have heavy ergonomics impacts but cannot be
covered by rules and standards. They have to be addressed through design based
on user scenarios and ergonomics lab sessions.</p>
<p>The deliverables for these guidelines are available for the Extended
Enterprise :
<ul>
  <li>A test matrix template, which has to be &quot;instantiated&quot; for each
    application and can be used to measure the compliancy to standards for each
    product line application</li>
  <li>A set of principles and rules, with the corresponding explanations and
    examples</li>
</ul>

<p>The following matrix is a template allowing measuring the standard compliancy
of the different applications. It has to be instantiated and completed for each
application:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="images/CAADocErgoCATDELMatrix.xls"><strong>CATIA-DELMIA Ergonomics
  Matrix</strong></a></p>
  <p><a href="images/CAADocErgoENOVIAMatrix.xls"><strong>ENOVIA Ergonomics
  Matrix</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We tried to make this matrix usable and straightforward without accessing the
complete rule descriptions.</p>
<p>There is one line per rule and the columns have to be completed for each
application:
<ul>
  <b>
  <li>First column:</b> the application by itself (just put its name)</li>
  <b>
  <li>Second set of columns:</b> the different zones or views of the application
  window. One column per zone or view</li>
  <b>
  <li>Third set of columns: </b>the different types of objects managed by the
  application. One column per object type</li>
  <b>
  <li>Fourth set of columns:</b> the different commands of the application. One
  column per command</li>
</ul>
<p>We have only put in the matrix the important rules for the applications.</p>

<p>We are establishing principles and rules for all the lines of products of
Dassault Systemes and they are all grouped together. You will see it when
accessing them on the Ergonomics web site.</p>
<p>So, when do you have to follow a rule?</p>
<p>First, you have to know on which &quot;platform&quot; runs the application.
Today an application can run on two platforms, the <b>Wintop</b> and the <b>Webtop</b>
(the term Portal may also be used in this context).</p>
<p>A rule can be applicable on all platforms or on only certain platforms; this
is defined through a marking just at the left of the rule title.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="7" width="631">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Win</b></td>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Web</b></td>
    <td width="76%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Rule XXX </b>(this rule is applicable for
      all platforms)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="7" width="631">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Web</b></td>
    <td width="76%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Rule YYY </b>(this rule is applicable for
      the Webtop only)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="7" width="631">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Win</b></td>
    <td width="8%" valign="MIDDLE">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="76%" valign="MIDDLE"><b>Rule ZZZ </b>(this rule is applicable for
      the Wintop only)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The current correspondence (V5R4) between the products and the platforms is
the following:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="7" width="631" align="LEFT" hspace="12">
  <tr>
    <td width="21%" valign="TOP"><b>
      <p align="CENTER">Line of products</b></td>
    <td width="21%" valign="TOP"><b>
      <p align="CENTER">Platform</b></td>
    <td width="57%" valign="TOP"><b>
      <p align="CENTER">Comments</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="21%" valign="TOP">

    <td width="21%" valign="TOP">

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td width="21%" valign="TOP">
      <p align="CENTER">Webtop</td>
    <td width="57%" valign="TOP">DMU Navigator in the ENOVIA Portal Foundation
      is based on the Wintop platform</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="21%" valign="TOP">
      <p align="CENTER">DENEB</td>
    <td width="21%" valign="TOP">
      <p align="CENTER">Wintop</td>
    <td width="57%" valign="TOP">&nbsp;</td>

<h3><a name="Rules classification">Rules classification</a></h3>
<p>The rules are classified with the following structure:
<ol>
  <li><a href="CAADocErgoTopic1.htm">Interface components</a></li>
  <li><a href="CAADocErgoTopic2.htm">Interaction techniques</a></li>
  <li><a href="CAADocErgoTopic3.htm">Input basics</a></li>
  <li><a href="CAADocErgoTopic4.htm">Visual design</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The rules we are publishing at Dassault Systemes are defined and prioritized
to fit the needs of our lines of products. But they do not pretend to be
complete, their purpose is to guide and measure our applications.</p>
<p>We have chosen this classification to be able to make reference easily to the
Windows standards published by Microsoft. Even for the Webtop environment, most
of these rules are applicable.</p>
<p>The current Windows reference book about user interface is &quot;<b>Microsoft
Windows User Experience: Official Guidelines for User Interface Developers and
Designers</b>&quot; published by Microsoft Press in 1999 (ISBN 0-7356-0566-1).
It replaces the previous book called &quot;<b>The Windows Interface Guidelines
for Software Design</b>&quot;. However the changes are not that big so the
previous book is still an excellent reference.</p>

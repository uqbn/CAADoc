<h3><a name="What"></a>What Is a CATlet</h3>
<p>Basically a CATlet can be assimilated to a Java Bean but it is a more than a
Java Bean in the way it is designed to fit inside the Portal and as such has
built-in functionalities to enhance this integration. But don't mess with this:
we didn't say a CATlet can only exist inside the Portal. As a standard Java Bean
a CATlet can be instantiated anywhere outside the Portal and any Java Bean can
be instantiated inside the Portal (but with a degraded integration).
<p>A CATlet is a graphical container and is built around the
model-view-controller paradigm (named MVC afterward). The CATlet is itself the
controller of the whole component and aggregates its views and models. A CATlet
can have many views and models but most of the time it has only one for each. Be
careful that we use the term CATlet to represent two things: the whole component
(Model View and Controller) as well as the controller itself. This may be
confusing but in fact they represent quite the same thing: The CATlet is the
graphical controller component added inside the Portal and it is the only part
of the MVC, visible from outside.<br>
All the intelligence of the MVC component is located in the CATlet (the
Controller). The model is meant to store the data of this component and the view
to display whole or part of these data. Model and view are instantiated by the
CATlet. They should not know (i.e. no reference) each other or the CATlet that
created them. This way you strongly reduce the tight between components and
views or models can be reused in other contexts.<br>
Now, these three components (model, view and controller) have to communicate
which each others. As the CATlet knows (i.e. has a reference) the model and the
view, the CATlet communicates with the model and the view via method calls. As
the model knows neither the view nor the CATlet it can only communicate with
them by sending events, subscription being through the CATlet. For the view it
is the same kind of communication as for the model with the difference that
usually the view doesn't have to directly communicate with the model.<br>
The communication flow between these components is as follow:
<ul>
  <li>a user interaction occurs in the view, it is analyzed by the view and and
    the view warns the CATlet with an event that something happened
  <li>the CATlet analyzes the view's event and edits the model with direct
    function calls.</li>
  <li>as the model is edited, it fires events to warn that its data have changed</li>
  <li>these event are received by the view that update its representation
    accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Concept"></a>CATlet Concepts and Basic Processes</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="images/CATletsCom.gif" nosavewidth= "689"height= "368"> </p>
<p>Main statements from this schema are that</p>
<ul>
  <li>CATlets are independant component based on the model of java-beans and the
    model-view-controller structure</li>
  <li>As independant java-beans, CATlet can communicate with each other and with
    their container through different services like the CommonSupport or the
    Hookup for events publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>To program a CATlet, a programmer needs to write the client
model-view-controller of its CATlet (using base classes delivered by the
infrastructure), write the communication classes (event listener and publisher).

<h4><a name="Reusable"></a>Making Components Reusable: the Java-Beans Component
Model</h4>
<p>A java-bean is a elementary Java component allowing to users to build other
components. Each CATlet is also a java-bean and is itself made of other
java-beans.</p>
<p>To be considered as a java-bean, a component must follow the Java Bean design
patterns. These design patterns describe mainly how to define your object
methods, its events and properties. Following this design pattern make a lot
easier communication and connection between beans as well a configuration of
your object at runtime. Please refer to the JavaBean specification document for
more detail about this design pattern.
<p>An important property of the java-beans event model is that to communicate,
beans don't have to know each other at build time. This way, beans can be
completely independent, providing the following benefits :
<ul>
  <li>communication between beans is standardized and easy to do : it helps
    understand existing code, as well as designing and implementing new code</li>
  <li>as beans contain no reference to other beans, they are independent and
    reusable in any environment welcoming beans</li>
  <li>thanks to the java-beans introspection mechanism, a bean can easily
    describes its interface at runtime, allowing it to be used in visual
    builders.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Inside"></a>Inside a CATlet: The beanified Model-View-Controller</h4>
<h5>Description and benefits</h5>
<p>A CATlet is basically made of three kind of elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the model, which basically contains data, editors on these data.</li>
  <li>the view which basically displays the data contained inside the model and
    processes user interactions.</li>
  <li>the controller which basically interprets the user interaction processed
    by the view and edits the model.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beanified MVC protocol describes precisely the events and properties
flows between the model, view and controller. The benefits of this protocol are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>this protocol can be repeated over and over in a CATlet design : this help
    for the design.</li>
  <li>the infrastructure provides base classes to implement this protocol : this
    help for the implementation</li>
  <li>this protocol allows to attach more than one view to the same model</li>
  <li>this protocol allows to attach more than one model to the same view</li>
  <li>this protocol allows to create new views and attach them to an already</li>
  existing model without modifying it (if the model can provide its data in the
  right flavor)
</ul>
<b>So you need to design and implement CATlet as beanified MVC components.</b>
<h5>Basic process</h5>
This describes how to program a beanified MVC to make a CATlet.
<p>The controller must extend one of these classes CATlet or JCATlet (AWT or
Swing implentation of the ICAtlet interface) from the package
com.dassault_systemes.catweb.base.catlet. Within it you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>manage the communication with other CATlets (see Communicating with other
    CATlets)</li>
  <li>implement the CATlet abstract methods to allow the Portal to communicate
    with your CATlet and manage its life cycle (see Communicating with the
    Portal and the CATlet life Cycle)</li>
  <li>create the views and models components. The controller is the only entity
    to have and keep a reference on its models and views</li>
  <li>as the CATlet is also a graphical container, handle the layout of its
    views (which have been previously added inside the CATlet)</li>
  <li>make the views subscribe to events fired by the models, at least
    PropertyChangeEvent but also ItemEvent or other model custom events</li>
  <li>subscribe the controller to events fired by the views</li>
  <li>edit and query the models</li>
</ul>
<p>The model must extend the class Model (from package
com.dassault_systemes.catweb.base.catlet.model). Within it you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>store and retrieve data and warn by firing a PropertyChangeEvent each time
    the data have been changed</li>
  <li>provide edit and query methods on these data</li>
  <li>handle the selection of these data and warn by firing an ItemEvent each
    time the selection content has changed</li>
</ul>
<p>The view must implement the interface ViewInterface (from package
com.dassault_systemes.catweb.base.catlet.view). Within it you need to</p>
<ul>
  <li>create the user interface objects</li>
  <li>upon reception of a PropertyChangeEvent which source is a model, retrieve
    data from this model and display them</li>
  <li>subscribe to low level interaction events from the user interface objects</li>
  <li>transform this low level events in high level events to re-dispatch them
    to the controller.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Communication flow at runtime</h5>
<p>The following diagram shows the different kind of communication that exist
between the models, views and controller :</p>

<h3><a name="ComCATlets"></a>Communication between CATlets: the Hookup Mechanism</h3>
<h5>Description and benefits</h5>
<p>The Hookup is a component delivered in the CATlet infrastructure that allows
you to make your CATlet communicating with each other without knowing
themselves.</p>
<p>The Hookup uses a publish-subscribe mechanism based on the java-beans events
model. When a CATlet is interested in listening some events, it must get a
reference on an object which fires these events to subscribe on it. When you
don't have a reference on such object, just tell the Hookup that you are
interesting in listening some particular events (this is called subscribing). On
the other side, when you may fire events, tell the Hookup that you can fire
these king of events (this is called publishing). This way, when the Hookup has
a subscriber interested in listening events that one of its publishers fire, it
will act as a third party and make this subscriber subscribes to this publisher
(as defined in the java-beans event model). Up to this point, both beans are
connected and when the publisher fires an event, the subscriber is notified on
the corresponding listener interface (as defined in the java-beans event model).</p>
<p>At no moment the publisher had a reference on the subscriber nor the
subscriber had a reference on the publisher. The drawback of this mechanism is
that you can't control to which CATlet you fire your events, except if the
events you fire contains additional information that will let the subscriber
filter the received events.</p>
<p>An other mechanism provided by the Hookup is the notion of persistent events.
If a publisher has fired an event and decided that this event will be
persistent, each time a new subscriber declares itself as being interested in
this kind of events, it will automatically receive this event.</p>
<h5>Basic process</h5>
<p>This describes briefly how to publish and subscribe</p>
<ul>
  <li>a publishing CATlet must have a BeanInfo class describing all the events
    it may fire</li>
  <li>for each XXX event the CATlet may fire, it must implement a addXXXListener
    and removeXXXListener methods for the matching XXXListener interface</li>
  <li>the subscribing CATlet must implement the XXXListener interface that
    contains the methods on which this listener will be called back when the
    event is fired.</li>
  <li>when needed, the publishing CATlet must inform the Hookup that it may fire
    the events described in its BeanInfo class. At any time this publisher may
    also inform the Hookup that it no more wants to publish its events.</li>
  <li>when needed, the subscribing CATlet must inform the Hookup that it is
    interested in some kind of event. At any time this subscriber may also
    inform the Hookup that it is no more interested in receiving this event.
  <li>when needed, a publisher may inform the Hookup that it wants to made this
    event persistent.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ComDesktop"></a>Communication with the Portal Desktop</h3>
<p>In order to benefit from services of the environment it lives in, the CATlet
may communicate with it. Even if the CATlet's main and dedicated environment is
the Portal desktop, it may have others environment it doesn't know.&nbsp; This
is why all the requests are processed to the CommonSupport which redirects them
to interfaces which implementation differ from the environment. The requests
this CommonSupport object support are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>send various messages to display (errors, warnings, infos)</li>
  <li>show and hide waiting cursors for all CATlets</li>
  <li>query if the current mode is application or applet</li>
  <li>make the environment create and start a CATlet by its name</li>
  <li>display the properties of a CATlet</li>
  <li>display an URL</li>
</ul>
<p>As the environment in which the CATlets live may change, some of these
requests may be processed or not depending on the capabilities of the
environment.</p>

<h3><a name="LifeCycle"></a>The CATlet Life Cycle</h3>
<p>The CATlet life cycle is the following one:</p>
<img border="1" src="images/CATletLifeCycle.gif" nosavewidth= "631"height= "142"> 
<p>At each state of this life cycle, the CATlet may take special action:
<ul>
  <li>creation : the CATlet initialize itself. At this time, the CATlet is not
    already added in its environment (the Portal desktop for example)</li>
  <li>start : the CATlet is now added in its environment. This is in this state
    that the models and views are usually created. Events subscription and
    publishing may also take place here.</li>
  <li>activation : the CATlet has been activated by the end user and is now
    ready to receive user interaction.</li>
  <li>deactivation : the CATlet has been deactivated by the end user and does
    not receive user interaction any more.</li>
  <li>stop : the CATlet is about to removed from its environment. Events
    un-subscription and un-publishing usually take place here. Persistent data
    may also be saved here.</li>
  <li>cleanup : the CATlet is about to be destroyed. The CATlet must clean up
    itself to ease the task of the garbage collector.</li>
</ul>

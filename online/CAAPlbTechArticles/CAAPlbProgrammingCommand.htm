<h3><a name="MVC"></a>A Command is a Mini MVC</h3>
<p>A command can be considered as an extension of the CATlet. The CATlet manages
its data inside its model, the representation of its data inside its view and
has some basic functionalities inside its controller. Commands are here to add
functionalities to the CATlet and as such have also a MVC structure. The command
has its own controller and may have views and models, sharing some of them with
the CATlet it extends.<br>
Relations between models - views - controller are of the same kind as those for
a CATlet, even with models and views shared with the CATlet. That is to say that
communication from controller to models and controller to views are made by
function calls and communication from models to views, views to controller and
models to controller are made by java events.

<h3><a name="Header"></a>The Header, a Memory and Time Saver</h3>
<p>Users can write a lot of complex commands around a CATlet. Instantiating all
these commands when starting the CATlet can be very costly in term of resources
(memory and time). Also, most of these commands have the same kind of
representation, this may cause code duplication between commands.<br>
To avoid all of that, a Command Header has been created. It is a lightweight
class that handles a basic representation for Commands. It also manages the
Command life cycle: the command is instantiated when needed (i.e. when started),
and destroyed when its task is finished (i.e. when stopped). This way, resources
can be optimized.<br>
Note: When the command is suspended, it is not destroyed as it may be resumed
later.<br>
The Header is completely configurable through the CATlet's workshop file (see
... for more details). However, if it is not sufficient, users can still create
their own Header class.

<h3><a name="CommandClass"></a>Identity Card of the Command class</h3>
<p>The command class is an abstract class located inside the <i><code>com.dassault_systemes.catweb.base.catlet.command</code></i>
package. As an abstract class, it has methods that you must implement and other
that have a basic implementation. Here is a description of these methods and
attributes:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>protected ViewInterface[] views;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This attribute represents the views of this command. You can store inside
this array the command's own views or the views the command shares with the
CATlet.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>protected Model temporaryModel;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This attribute represents the models of this command. You can store inside
this array the command's own models or the models the command shares with the
CATlet.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public abstract void initialize();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This method is the first one called after the constructor. It is called by
the Portal desktop when the context for the command has been fully created
(CATlet creation, GUI realization ...). The <i><code>setMasterCATlet() </code></i>method
has already been called. It is advised to place inside this method subscription
on Hookup events and some subscription on models or views shared with the
CATlet.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public abstract void start();

public abstract void stop();

public abstract void resume();

public abstract void suspend();

public abstract void cleanup();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These methods define the life cycle of the command. The command is always
start at first, then it may be suspended then resumed during its activation,
then it is stopped to be eventually cleaned-up when the command is destroyed.
All these methods are called by the Command Selector. You should never call
them. It is advised to put in these methods subscription and un-subscription to
models and views for event that you just need to listen during the activation of
the command. It is also advised to put there selection or un-selection of
command's representation.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void addCommandListener(CommandListener list);

public void removeCommandListener(CommandListener list);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These methods are used by the command selector to subscribe or unsubscribe to
command events fired by the command. You shouldn't have to use them.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void fireCommandEvent(CommandEvent evt);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the command wants to be started or stopped, it should fire a command
event using this method. As the CommandSelector has previously subscribed to
this event, it will receive it and therefore start or stop the command.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void setMasterCATlet(CATlet catlet);

public CATlet getMasterCATlet();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each command is an extension of a instantiated CATlet. This CATlet is set
with the <i><code>setMasterCATlet</code></i> method. Using the <i><code>getMasterCATlet
</code></i>method you will be able to access models or views of this CATlet.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public String getName();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This method return the name of this command. It is instantiated in the
Command class so that name is directly fetched from bean info using
introspection mechanism. Users should overload it.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public int getActivationMode()

public void setActivationMode(int mode)</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each command runs with an activation mode, shared or exclusive. This means
that when starting, a shared command will suspend the currently running command
while an exclusive command will stop it. Commands are shared by default, but it
can be useful to make a command exclusive if it changes dramatically data so
that old suspended command have no meaning in being resumed.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public boolean isDeletable()</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As the Command life cycle is handled by its Header, most Command are
destroyed after being stopped. But for some reasons, you may want your Command
not to be destroyed (long creation time ...). For that, overload the <i>isDeletable</i>
method so that it returns false. By default, <i>isDeletable</i> returns true.
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="HeaderClass"></a>Identity Card of the CmdHeader Class</h3>
<p>As the Command class, the CmdHeader class is defined in the <i><code>com.dassault-systemes.catweb.base.catlet.command</code></i>
package.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>protected Class commandClass;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the Header has to instantiate the Command, it used its Class, specified
during the reading of the CATlet's workshop description file.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>protected Command command;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This field is the current instance of the Command object the Header handles.
Be careful that most of the time this field is null as the Command is destroyed
when stopped.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>protected Vector repList;

protected Vector repPool;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When handling the Command's representations, the Header as a sort of cache.
The repList field stores reps that have instantiated and which are being
displayed whereas repPool stores reps that have been instantiated but that are
not displayed. When the Header is asked to create a rep, it first looks into
repPool if there is a rep of this type. If this is the case, it removes the rep
from repPool and adds it in repList. Otherwise it creates the rep and add it in
repList. On the contrary, when the Header is asked to delete a rep, it removes
it from repList and adds it into repPool.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void cleanup();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Called when the Header is destroyed (usually when the CATlet is destroyed).</p>
<table class="code">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>public boolean isSelected();

public void setSelected(boolean flag);</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The Header handles the command representation. When a Command is started or
resumed, its reps must be selected.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public boolean isEnabled();

public void setEnabled(boolean flag);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Given the context, a Command may be available or not. To make a Command
unavailable, the Header must disable its rep.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public boolean isVisible();

public void setVisible(boolean flag);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Some Commands may have no representations and as such are invisible. The <i>setVisible</i>
method shouldn't be called by users as it is set during the reading of the
CATlet's workshop description file, where Headers are declared visible or
invisible.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public CATlet getMasterCATlet();

public void setMasterCATlet(CATlet catlet);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Most of the Commands are attached to a CATlet (except Frame's Commands).
Using the master CATlet, the Header can retrieve the CATlet's CommandSelector
object to subscribe it to its Command.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public CommandSelector getCommandSelector();

public void setCommandSelector(CommandSelector selector);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Some Headers are not attached to a CATlet, but still need a CommandSelector.
They can use the <i>getCommandSelector</i> to get one.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public Class getCommandClass();

public String getCommandClassName();

public void setCommandClassName();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The Header instantiate dynamically the Command it handles. For that, it needs
the Command's class name to create a Class object and later instances of this
Command. The <i>setCommandClassName</i> method is called during the reading of
the CATlet's workshop description file where it is specified which Command the
Header will instantiate.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void setMenuRepClassName(String name);

public void setToolbarRepClassName(String name);

public void setCtxMenuRepClassName(String name);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The Header instantiate dynamically its representations as they can be
configured in the CATlet's workshop description file.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public boolean isValid();

public void setValid(boolean flag);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These methods are remapped on isEnabled() and setEnabled()</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public CmdRep createToolbarRep(JComponent parent);

public void destroyToolbarRep(CmdRep rep);

public CmdRep createMenuRep(JComponent parent);

public void destroyMenuRep(CmdRep rep);

public CmdRep createCtxMenuRep(JComponent parent);

public void destroyCtxMenuRep(CmdRep rep);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As the Header manages the Command's representations, it must create them but
also destroy them. See the repList and repPool fields description for an
explanation of the cache mechanism. When created, the rep is given the Command's
name and icon as described in the Command's BeanInfo.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As the Header manages the Command's representations, it listens these reps
events to be warned when a rep has been selected. The <i>startCommand</i> method
is then called.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void startCommand();</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This method is called when the Header must start its Command. In order, the
Command is created (if necessary), the master CATlet is given to this Command,
the CommandSelector is subscribed to CommandEvent from this Command, the Command
is initialized, and finally the Header ask the Command to send a <i>CommandEvent</i>
to the CommandSelector to be really started.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As the Command can be started, suspended, resumed or stopped, the
representations must reflect these state (selected when started or resumed and
unselected when stopped or suspended). Each time the Command state changes, it
fires a PropertyChangeEvent which is listened by the Header which changed the
representations state accordingly.</p>
<p>Now that the command has been introduced, some topics on how to implement a
command will be presented in a sort of FAQ.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><i><b>What do I put inside the start, stop, suspend and resume methods?</b></i>
<p>These methods are called during the life cycle of the command. You can put
inside these methods subscription and un-subscription to events. For example, if
your command is a manipulator command, it will listen mouse event fired by your
view and then take action depending on the position of the mouse. You just want
it to take action when it is active, so subscribe to mouse events in your start
and resume methods and unsubscribe in your stop and suspend methods.
<p><i><b>What is the difference between start and resumed, stop and suspended?</b></i>
<p>Start is called when a Command's representation has been selected. The
Command has just been created and has no context and must begin from nothing.
When resumed is called, the Command has already been started and suspended, so
there is already an existing context for this Command from which the Command
must continue its task.<br>
Stop is called when the Command has really ended its task or when a exclusive
Command has been started. Just after being stopped, the Command is destroyed, so
its existing context won't be reusable. Suspended is called when a shared
command has been started. The Command is temporary interrupted but its context
must be saved so that when it is resumed it can use this context to continue its
task.
<p><i><b>How do I get a reference on the models and views of the CATlet my
command extends?</b></i>
<p>When your command is created and before it is initialized, the Header will
call the <i>setMasterCATlet</i> method on it. By calling the <i>getMasterCATlet</i>
method your will get a reference on your CATlet and then you can call the <i>getView()</i>
and <i>getModel() </i>methods on this CATlet to get what you need.
<p><b><i>How do I declare my command?</i></b>
<p>Commands are declared in the *.workshop file of your CATlet. ([2] See how to
specify a Workshop organization).<br>
Even if the command is declared multiple times in this file, it will be
instantiated only once and will be differentiated with its representation. But
be careful that a command can only be declared once in all the menu bar and once
in all the toolbars.
<p><i><b>I have declared my command inside the workshop file but it doesn't
appears inside the frame</b></i>
<p>There can be different explanations. The most current is that you didn't
provide a bean info for your command or it is unobtainable. If it is the case,
the command's name and icon can't be found a no representation will be
constructed for your command.<br>
Don't providing a bean info can also be a way to have a command without
representation. This can be useful for some commands (like the load models
commands which don't need any representations).
<p><i><b>What must I put in the bean info of my command?</b></i>
<p>Commands bean info are used for its representation. This is where the name
and icon are fetched. Here is a small example of a bean info:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public class LookAtCommandBeanInfo extends CommandBeanInfo
{
  public EventSetDescriptor[] getPublishedEventDescriptors()
  {
    return null;
  }

  public PropertyDescriptor[] getPropertyDescriptors()
  {
    return null;
  }

  public BeanDescriptor getBeanDescriptor()
  {
    String COMMAND_TITLE = BaseV4Language.widgetsRB.getString(&quot;LookAt_Command_Title&quot;);
    BeanDescriptor desc=super.getBeanDescriptor();
    desc.setDisplayName(COMMAND_TITLE);
    return desc;
  }

  public Image[] getIcons(int iconKind)
  {
    if(iconKind != CommandBeanInfo.ICON_COLOR_30x30) return null;
    Image image = ImageLoader.loadImagefromClassRoot(&quot;Resources/I_LookAt.gif&quot;);
    Image[] icons = {image};
    return icons;
  }

  public Image getIcon(int iconKind)
  {
    return getIcons(iconKind)[0];
  }
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><i><b>I don't like the standard representation of my command. How can I
change it?</b></i>
<p>You have two possibilities. First is to defined an other RepClassName for
this Header that manages this Command. This can work if the new CmdRep has the
same kind of behavior as default CmdRep. Otherwise, you have to write your own
CmdHeader and handle your rep inside by overloading a createXXXRep method. Here
a sample code of a command which representation inside a menu is not a menu item
but a submenu:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public CmdRep createMenuRep(JComponent parent)
{
  // --- first check if the rep hasn't already been instantiated
  if(menuRep != null)
  {
    JComponent ui = menuRep.getUI();

    // --- sometimes commands don't have ui
    if(ui != null)
    {
      if(ui.getParent() != null)
      ui.getParent().remove(ui);
      parent.add(ui);
    }
    return menuRep;
  }

  menuRep = new CmdSubmenuRep(getName());
  if(parent != null &amp;&amp; menuRep.getUI() != null)
  {
    // --- creates menu items for installed look and feel
    UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[] lfList = UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels();
    ButtonGroup buttonGroup = new ButtonGroup();
    
    for(int i=0;i&lt;lfList.length;i++)
    {
      JCheckBoxMenuItem item = new JCheckBoxMenuItem(lfList[i].getName());
      
      // --- subscribes to Item Event
      item.addItemListener(this);

      // --- adds the item
      menuRep.getUI().add(item);
      buttonGroup.add(item);
      
      // --- if this is the current look and feel, select item
      if(lfList[i].getClassName().compareTo(UIManager.getLookAndFeel().getClass().getName()) == 0)
      {
        item.setState(true);
      }
    }
    parent.add(menuRep.getUI());
    parent.validate();
  }

  // --- subscribes to action events from this cmdRep
  menuRep.addActionListener(this);
  return menuRep;
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><i><b>Sometimes, I want my command's representations to appears disabled. How
must I proceed?</b></i>
<p>Given the data contained inside the CATlet model, you may want your command
disabled. For that, you must write your own CmdHeader and given the context call
the setValid method with the right flag. This method will then enable or disable
all the representations this Header manages. Here is a sample code of the
SelectionHeader that is enabled only when there is a selection inside the model.
The header subscribe to itemEvent form the CATlet's model and is called on the
itemStateChange method when the selection has changed:
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>public void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent evt)
{
  if(evt.getSource() == models[0])
  {
    boolean valid = isValid();
    setValid(valid);
  }
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><i><b>I'm done with my command and now I want it to be stopped. What must I
do?</b></i>
<p>You've just to send a CommandEvent with the right flag in it:<br>
<i><code>fireCommandEvent(new CommandEvent(this,this,CommandEvent.UNSELECTED));</code></i>
<p><i><b>I want my command to be exclusive. How can I change the default
setting?</b></i>
<p>In your command constructor, call the <i><code>setActivationMode(Command.EXCLUSIVE_MODE)</code></i>
method. This way, your command will stop the current running command instead of
suspending it. If you want to reverse to the shared mode, call the <i><code>setActivationMode(Command.SHARED_MODE)</code></i>
method.
<p><i><b>I want my command to listen Bus events.</b></i>
<p>Sometimes, Command can be started non-interactively by an event published on
the Bus. For that, the Command must always be instantiated and not only when
started. To achieve this, specify in the CATlet's workshop description file that
the header to use for your Command is a <i>com.dassault-systemes.catweb.base.catlet.command.PermanentCommandHeader</i>.
<p><i><b>I've written my own header and my command's rep are not selected when
started, or they are still selected when stopped. What happens?</b></i>
<p>The <i>CmdHeader</i> class implements the PropertyChangeListener interface to
be aware when the Command's state has changed and so modify the reps
accordingly. If your own CmdHeader implements <i>PropertyChangeListener</i>, you
must not forget to call <i>super.propertyChange(evt)</i> in your own <i>propertyChange</i>
method, otherwise reps won't reflect the Command's real state.

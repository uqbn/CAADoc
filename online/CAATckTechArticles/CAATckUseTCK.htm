<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>TCK stands for <b>T</b>ool <b>C</b>onfiguration <b>K</b>ey and is a label identifying a
specific installation of a set of tools. Different TCKs can be defined for either 

<ul>
  <li>installing different tools</li>
  <li>installing different set of tools</li>
  <li>installing different levels of the same tools</li>
</ul>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="TCK attributes"></a>TCK Attributes</h4>

<p>Any TCK is defined by a set of attributes and a set of tools: 

<ul>
  <li>A unique identifier.<br>
    It is what we call the TCK, that is to say the string identifying a set of tools when
    running a TCK command.</li>
  <li>The author (read-only).<br>
    The login name of the user who created the TCK.</li>
  <li>The last modification date (read-only).<br>
    Any modification on an existing TCK causes this date to be updated.</li>
  <li>A set of environment variables.<br>
    They are used only when TCKs are managed by a TCK server.<br>
    They are set in the user's environment before calling tools's profiles.</li>
  <li>A set of tools.<br>
    Tools can be shared by TCKs and each tool is defined by a set of attributes. <ul>
      <li>A unique identifier.<br>
        It is a string used by TCK commands to specified a particular tool.</li>
      <li>The last modification date (read-only).<br>
        Any modification on an existing tool causes this date to be updated.</li>
      <li>A set of profiles.<br>
        Any tool can own one Unix profile and one Windows-NT profile.<br>
        If two different profiles exist on the same platform, then two different tools must be
        declared.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Site or local management"></a>Site or Local Management</h4>

<p>TCKs can be created either locally on each user's machine or on a specific host that we
call the TCK server host.</p>

<p><a name="Type of installation"></a>The ability to perform local registration or to
retrieve information from a TCK server depends on the type of TCK installation chosen when
installing the CAA2 Development Toolkit product: 

<ol>
  <li>If the &quot;NoServer&quot; setup was chosen, only local registrations are possible.</li>
  <li>If the &quot;Client&quot; setup was chosen, both local and remote registrations are
    possible.</li>
  <li>However, it is not possible to launch a TCK server on that host.</li>
  <li>If the &quot;Server&quot; setup was chosen, the host is considered as being the TCK
    server host and then a TCK server can be launched.</li>
</ol>

<p>To know which kind of installation has been set up on a machine, consult this <a
href="#Retrieving the type of TCK installation">section</a>.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Site and local management"></a>Site and Local Management</h4>

<p>TCK commands support two levels of registration: 

<ul>
  <li>TCKs defined at site level : they correspond to TCKs managed by a TCK server and they
    can be used from any host where a &quot;<a href="#Type of installation">Client</a>&quot;
    installation has been done.</li>
  <li>TCKs defined at host level : they correspond to TCKs defined locally on a machine and
    they can be used only from that machine. Local registrations can be done on any host where
    a &quot;NoServer&quot; or &quot;Client&quot; installation has been done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the way TCKs are registered, there can be several definitions of the same
TCK (site and local). Here is some explanations for understanding which TCK is chosen by
TCK commands. 

<ul>
  <li>If a &quot;NoServer&quot; installation has been set up, only local registrations are
    available and there is only one definition for a given TCK.</li>
  <li>If a &quot;Client&quot; or &quot;Server&quot; installation has been set up, both site
    and local registrations can be done. In this case, there are three situations: <ul>
      <li>A given TCK exists only locally: this TCK will be chosen automatically.</li>
      <li>A given TCK exists only on the TCK server: this TCK will be chosen automatically.</li>
      <li>A given TCK exists both locally and on the TCK server: a temporary TCK is generated by
        selecting all the tools defined in the two TCKs. However, if the same tool is found in
        both TCKs, the local tool definition is selected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>What is the interest of having a TCK defined both on current host and on the TCK
server?</b></p>

<p>It is easier for installing new tools or new versions of tools to declare them on a
single host (the TCK server host). However, if some tools are composed of big modules, the
local network might be heavily loaded by users running the tools over the network. In this
case it is interesting to install tools on users' machines to avoid network access: 

<ul>
  <li>For a daily use of tools, it is advised to install tools locally on users' machine.</li>
  <li>For a non frequent use, the use of a TCK server avoids the installation of tools on all
    machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another interest of having two definitions of the same TCK is when testing an
application based upon tools managed by TCKs. If a new version of a given tool must be
tested, this new version of the tool can be installed on a host and declared locally the
official TCK but with a different location for the associated tool.</p>

<h3><a name="TCKInstallationPanel"></a>TCK Box in RADE Installation Program</h3>

<p>This section describes the different installations that are available from
the TCK Box displayed when installing the CAA RADE V5 CD-ROM.</p>

<p><a name="LocalInstallation"></a>&quot;Local&quot; Installation</p>

<p>This installation corresponds to the choice &quot;No Server Setup&quot; in
the figure hereafter. It is proposed by default and corresponds to an
installation which is visible only from the current host. However it is shared
by all users working on this host.</p>

<p>The TCKs corresponding to the new installation will be added to the ones that
have been installed already on the current host (use <a href="#Listing defined TCKs">tck_list</a>
to list them).</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/CAATck1.jpg" width="830" height="536"></p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<p><a name="ClientInstallation"></a>&quot;Client&quot; Installation</p>

<p>This installation corresponds to the choice &quot;Client Setup&quot; in the
figure hereafter. The purpose of the &quot;client&quot; installation is to
generate a tck_init profile which is suitable for accessing a TCK server that is
running on the host specified in the &quot;Server Name&quot; field and using the
port number specified in the &quot;Communication port for TCK server&quot;
field.</p>

<p>The interest of choosing the &quot;Client&quot; installation is when a
&quot;Server&quot; installation has been done on another host and for a CAA RADE
installation path <u>that is visible from the other hosts on the local network</u>.
In that case, the &quot;Client&quot; installation can be done on all other hosts
by specifying the host where the &quot;Server&quot; installation has been done
and the same port as given for this &quot;Server&quot; installation.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/warning.gif" width="30" height="30">
If the &quot;Server&quot; installation was performed on a UNIX platform with the 
user &quot;root&quot;, it is mandatory to run other &quot;Client&quot; installations 
with a user named &quot;root&quot; or &quot;CAA&quot;. Otherwise the &quot;Client&quot; 
installations will not be able to modify the TCKs created by the &quot;Server&quot; installation.</P>

<P>At the end of the &quot;Server&quot; installation a TCK daemon has been started, running 
with the user &quot;root&quot;. The TCKs created by this installation is owned by the user &quot;CAA&quot;. 
When modifying an existing TCK, the server checks that you are the owner of this TCK or the 
same user that is running the TCK server. In this case, only the user &quot;CAA&quot; and 
the user &quot;root&quot; are allowed to modify the TCK. The &quot;Client&quot; installation 
on Windows, which will use the existing TCK server running on UNIX, will try to update the 
TCK on the server to add the Windows profiles for each tools (mkmk, mkCheckSource, SCM .). 
If the user used for the &quot;Client&quot; installation is neither &quot;CAA&quot; nor &quot;root&quot;, 
the TCK server will not allow the modification of the TCK.</P>

<p><img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/warning.gif" width="30" height="30">
It is important that the directory where the CAA RADE V5 CD-ROM has been
installed on the TCK server is seen with <u>the same path</u> from hosts where a
&quot;Client&quot; installation has been done.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../CAAIcons/images/information.gif" width="31" height="30">
It is possible to specify a TCK server corresponding to an older RADE
installation. If this TCK server is running while installing the new version,
the new TCKs will be registered automatically in this server.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/CAATck2.jpg" width="830" height="536"></p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<p><a name="ServerInstallation"></a>&quot;Server&quot; Installation</p>

<p>This installation corresponds to the choice &quot;Server Setup&quot; in the
figure hereafter. Its purpose is to install RADE on one host and to start a TCK
server on this host in order to let other hosts to access this installation.
Here are the steps to go through to achieve such an installation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Perform a &quot;Server&quot; installation using the path P, on host X and
    using port Y (note that X must be the host where the installation being
    done)</li>
  <li>Start the TCK server on X as follows (example given for UNIX platform and
    Sun operating system)<table class="code">

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a &quot;<a href="#ClientInstallation">Client</a>&quot;
    installation on each host from which you want to access the
    &quot;Server&quot; installation</li>
  <li>Mount X:P on each &quot;Client&quot; host using the same path P ((example
    given for UNIX platform, Sun operating system and using a &quot;hard&quot;
    mount):<table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td><pre>$ mount X:P /
$</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Execute the tck_init profile of the &quot;Client&quot; installation:<table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td><pre>$ . &lt;local_client_installation_path&gt;/solaris_a/code/command/tck_init

...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>

  <dd>The tck_profile command is the command to be used for setting up a working environment

    The main command parameter is a TCK identifier. The purpose of the command is to set some <a
    href="#Associating env variables with TCKs">environment variables</a> and to execute all
    the profiles that have been defined for all tools belonging to the TCK. Note that two
    profiles can be defined for a tool (Windows-NT and Unix) but the command will execute only
    the profile corresponding to the current platform. <p>If a path to a workspace is
    specified, it becomes the current working directory.</p>
    <p>For performance considerations, the tck_profile command does not execute tool's
    profiles when it is called twice in the same environment for the same TCK. However the
    command checks for the last modification date of the TCK to know if its definition has
    changed since the last execution: <ul>
      <li>if a new tool has been associated with a TCK, the TCK last modification date has changed</li>
      <li>if a tool definition has been modified, the TCK modification has changed</li>

<p>The <b>tck_update_local</b> command is used for registering or updating TCKs on the
current host.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to declare on current host a profile for a given tool and for a given
TCK. After the triplet (TCK, Tool, Profile) has been registered, the environment can be
set up by executing the tck_profile command with the given TCK as parameter. 

<dl>
  <dt>Syntax</dt>
  <dd><dl>
      <dt><code>tck_update_local TCK -tool Tool [-profile profile_path] [-remove] [-h|-help|-?]</code></dt>
      <dd><pre>TCK: identifier of the TCK for which the tool is being registered, modified or removed.
This parameter is not case-sensitive.</pre>
        <pre>-tool Tool: identifier of the tool being registered, modified or removed.
This parameter is not case-sensitive.</pre>
        <pre>[-profile profile_path]: path to the profile to execute for setting the environment.
This profile must be suitable for the platform where the command is executed (Windows-NT or Unix).</pre>
        <pre>[-remove]: this option is used for removing the association of the tool with the TCK.
The local tool definition is not destroyed since can be shared by several TCKs.</pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Usage</dt>
  <dd>The tck_update_local command has two behaviours regarding the way TCKs are managed on
    the local network: <ul>
      <li>If there is no TCK server, the command is used for creating, modifying and removing TCKs
        on current host.</li>
      <li>If a TCK server is available, the command is used to declare locally TCKs defined either
        on current host only or managed by the server but for which different tools' profiles must
        be used for the current host.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a TCK is defined both on the TCK server and on a given host, any TCK command that
    is executed on that host will select tools from the local TCK (for those existing in both
    declarations). The figure below shows what profiles are selected regarding the
    declarations of TCKs:</p>

<h4><a name="Registering a new TCK"></a>Registering a New TCK</h4>

<p>The <b>tck_create </b>command is used to register a new TCK in the server, changes in
an existing TCK can be done using the <a href="#Modifying TCK information">tck_modify</a>
command. 

<dl>
  <dt>Syntax</dt>
  <dd><dl>
      <dt><code>tck_create TCK [-from TCK] [-admin] [-h|-help|-?]</code></dt>
      <dd><pre>TCK: identifier of the TCK to be created.
This parameter is not case-sensitive.</pre>
        <pre>[-from TCK]: this option takes as parameter the identifier of an existing TCK.
This TCK is used for proposing defaults when creating the new one (variables, associated tools).</pre>
        <pre>[-admin]: this option indicates that the new TCK is not created for administration and not for all users.
See -admin and -off options of the tck_list command.</pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Usage</dt>
  <dd>The command is an interactive command and prompts the user for entering information, the
    execution falls down in three steps: <ol>
      <li>Description of the new TCK<br>
        The tool asks to enter a brief description of the purpose of the new TCK. This description
        will be displayed by the tck_list command afterwards.</li>
      <li>Variable definitions<br>
        The variables are those defined in the <a href="#Associating env variables with TCKs">variable
        file</a>. Each variable name is displayed with its default value and the command waits for
        the user to enter the new value or to keep the default one.</li>
      <li>Tool definitions<br>
        The information to enter for each tool are the identifier and the Unix and Windows-NT
        profiles, it is not mandatory to specify a profile on both platforms since a tool may
        exist on only one.<br>
        If the identifier corresponds to an existing tool, its profiles are displayed for
        information (they cannot be edited).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When the -from option is used to specify a reference TCK, the execution falls down in
    four steps: <ol>
      <li>Description of the new TCK<br>
        The tool asks to enter a brief description of the purpose of the new TCK. This description
        will be displayed by the tck_list command afterwards. As this description should be
        associated with only one TCK, there is no default proposed.</li>
      <li>Variables definitions<br>
        The default values are not those defined in the <a
        href="#Associating env variables with TCKs">variable file</a> but the ones defined for the
        reference TCK.</li>
      <li>Existing tool definitions<br>
        The tools associated with the reference TCK are listed and they can be kept or ignored.</li>
      <li>New tool definitions<br>
        The last step is the same as without the -from option: new tool can be associated to the
        new TCK.<br>
        If somes already exist, their profiles are listed but cannot be modified.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When the -from option is used, it is not possible to skip a tool definition. The <a
    href="#Removing a TCK">tck_remove</a> command can be used afterwards for removing a tool
    definition.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: it is not possible to refuse to associate a variable with a TCK. Either
    the default value is kept or a new value is entered. If some variables are specific to
    some TCKs or tools, they should be set up in tool profiles and not defined in the TCK
    variable file.</p>
    <p>Here are the different use cases: <ol>
      <li>Creation of a new TCK with new tools<br>
        Run the command &lt;tck_create tck&gt; and enter the values for the different variables,
        then enter the tool identifier and its Unix and Windows-NT profiles. If there is no
        profile on one platform, just press &quot;ENTER&quot; when the command prompts for it.<br>
        The commands loops on tool definitions and ends when no tool identifier is entered.</li>
      <li>Creation of a new TCK with both new and existiing tools<br>
        Run the command &lt;tck_create tck&gt; and enter the values for the different variables,
        then enter a tool identifier. If this identifier corresponds to an existing tool, its
        profiles are listed but cannot be modified.<br>
        The commands loops on tool definitions and ends when no tool identifier is entered.</li>
      <li>Creation of a new TCK having the same tools as another one<br>
        Run the command &lt;tck_create tck -from tck2&gt; where tck2 already exists. The command
        lists the identifiers of tools associated with tck2 and they can be kept (by pressing
        &quot;ENTER&quot;) or replaced by new tool (by entering new tool identifiers). When all
        tck2's tools have been listed, the command prompts for entering a tool identifier and ends
        when no one is entered.</li>
    </ol>

      <dd><pre>TCK: identifier of the TCK to remove or from which a tool is to be removed.
This parameter is not case-sensitive.</pre>
        <pre>[-tool Tool]: identifier of a tool to removed from the TCK.
This parameter is not case-sensitive.
Only the tool is removed, the TCK remains valid.</pre>

  <dt>Usage</dt>
  <dd>The command is useful for fixing incorrect information or removing obsolete TCKs and
    tools. <p>If a tool is shared by several TCKs, it is removed only in the given TCK.</p>
    <p>This command cannot be used for removing the variable in a TCK because only variables
    meaningful for any TCK should have been defined in the TCK server. The only way for
    removing a variable is to remove its definition in the the <a
    href="#Associating env variables with TCKs">variable file</a> and to restart server, then
    to use the<a href="#Modifying TCK information"> tck_modify</a> command for removing the
    variable from each TCK.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Examples</dt>
  <dd>In the following example, the command is used to remove the &quot;mkmk&quot; tool from
    the &quot;CXR4&quot; TCK.<table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td><pre>$ tck_remove CXR4 -tool mkmk</pre>
        </td>

<h4><a name="Associating env variables with TCKs"></a>Associating Environment Variables
with TCKs</h4>

<p>When using a TCK server, a set of environment variables can be associated with all TCKs
managed by this server. Note that the purpose of this feature is not to defined different
variables for different TCKs but for all TCKs: the setting of particular variable might be
done inside tools' profiles.</p>

<p>The variables names are defined in the file whose path is given by the <i>TCK_VAR_FILE</i>
environment variable. This variable is set in the working environment after having
executed the tck_init [<a href="#References">1</a>] file.</p>

<p>Each time a new TCK is being created (see <a href="#Registering a new TCK">tck_create</a>),
or an existing TCK is being modified (see <a href="#Modifying TCK information">tck_modify</a>),
the command prompts the user for setting each variable.</p>

<p>The TCK_VAR_FILE can be edited for addiing, modifying or removing some variables: the
file can contain empty lines or lines of the form</p>

<pre># a comment</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>VARIABLE VALUE</pre>

<p>A variable must be defined only once.<br>
Spaces or tabulations before a variable name or between the name and the value are ignored
but are kept when found in value.</p>

<p>After the file has been edited, the TCK server must be restarted because the server
loads the file in main memory.</p>

<p>Note that the new definition set has no direct impact on defined TCKs but the changes
will be taken into account by TCK editing commands: 

<ul>
  <li>for setting new variables, use the tck_modify command that will propose all variables
    including the new ones</li>
  <li>for removing variables, use the tck_modify command that will propose only variables
    defined in the variable file and will remove obsolete variable by side effect (it won't be
    proposed since no more managed by the TCK server).</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Retrieving the type of TCK installation"></a>Retrieving the Type of TCK
Installation</h4>

<p>This information is useful when deciding to manage TCKs by a server and checking that
the TCK installation on a given host is a &quot;Client&quot; installation.</p>

<p>To retrieve this information 

<ul>
  <li>Log on the host to be checked</li>
  <li>Set up the environment to access TCK commands (using the tck_init [<a href="#References">1</a>]
    profile).</li>
  <li>Check the value of the TCK_NO_SERVER environment variable:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If this variable is <u>not</u> defined, you have a &quot;Client&quot; installation.</li>
    <li>if this variable is defined, you have a &quot;NoServer&quot; installation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>In the case where you need to access a TCK server from a host where there is a
&quot;NoServer&quot; installation, you must (re)install the CAA2 Development Toolkit
products and select the &quot;Client&quot; setup in the TCK installation panel.</p>

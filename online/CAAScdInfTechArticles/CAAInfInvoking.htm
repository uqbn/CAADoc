<p>Access to the CATIA object model is provided using scripts in different ways
depending on the operating system and on the applications that can share their
own objects with CATIA. This also applies for ENOVIA DMU and DELMIA products. In 
the following you can subsitute &quot;DMU&quot; or &quot;DELMIA&quot; to &quot;CATIA&quot; if you need to 
access or launch another application based on the common V5 platform.</p>
<p>CATIA is an OLE Automation server for Windows and allows macro record and
replay for both Windows and UNIX. The following summarizes CATIA scripting
capabilities.</p>

<p>The macros recorded from the Tools menu and the Record Macro dialog box 
can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the VBScript language,</li>
  <li>the VBA language</li>
  <li>the CATScript language. This CATIA specific language 
  was designed to allow compatibility between the Unix Basic Script engine and 
  the Windows VBScript engine. As CATIA does'nt anymore hosts the Basic Script 
  engine on Unix since V5R7, it has only been kept for compatibility purpose. It 
  is actually processed by a VBScript engine after removal of the typing 
  information. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In-process access means that the script interpretation is performed in the
same process as CATIA. You usually run the macros from the Macros window
triggered from the interactive <b>Tools-&gt;Macros</b> command. In this case,
the macro is processed by CATIA just like any other command.</p>
<p>Out-process access means that you run the macro from another application
running in another process. In this case, the macro should first connect to
CATIA to then access its data. This connection starts CATIA if no CATIA process
is being running.</p>
<p>You can find information about in-process and out-process access in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="#InProcess">Running In-process Macros</a></b></li>
  <li><b><a href="#OutProcess">Running Out-process Macros</a></b></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="InProcess"></a>Running In-process Macros</h3>
<p>In-process access means that the script interpretation is performed in the
same process as CATIA using the scripting engine(s) hosted by CATIA. You can run
in-process macros with UNIX and Windows. You have three means to run in-process
macros:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You usually run the macros from the Macros window triggered from the
    interactive <b>Tools-&gt;Macros</b> command. In this case, the macro is
    processed by CATIA just like any other command.<br>
  Note that you can add arguments to the <code>
  CATMain</code> function:
  <pre><font color="#0000FF">  Sub</font> CATMain(X, Y)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">  ' Here we expect X as a scalar and Y as an object</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  MsgBox X&nbsp; &amp; TypeName(Y)
  <font color="#0000FF">End Sub</font></pre>
  <p>When launching such a macro, a dialog windows will 
  request valuation of arguments.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="images/CAAScdInfMacArgs.gif" width="314" height="267"></p>
  <p>Note that even if you use a macro language allowing to type 
  to those arguments, the types won't be user at runtime, so it is recommended 
  to give an explicit name to the variable to avoid end-user mystakes:</p>
  <pre><font color="#0000FF">  Sub</font> CATMain(iThisNumber, oThatObject)</pre>
</li>
  <li>You can start CATIA and request that a macro being executed as soon as
    CATIA is started using the -macro option followed by the full path of the
    macro you want to run:
    <pre>CNEXT -macro E:\Users\Macros\MacroToRun.CATScript</pre>
    This runs the <code>CATMain</code> function defined in the <code>MacroToRun.CATScript</code> file. 
  Macros can however be stored in other macro libraries like <code>catvba</code> 
  documents or any other V5 documents like <code>CATPart</code> or <code>
  CATProduct</code> documents. You can use the following syntax to run the <code>
  CATMain</code> function defined in the <code>myMacro</code> macro of the <code>
  myDocument</code> document:<pre>CNEXT -macro myDocument.catvba myMacro 
CNEXT -macro myDocument.CATPart myMacro</pre>
    CATIA sessions launched this way will remain active after the end of the 
  macro unless you explicitly end it in the macro using the <code>CATIA.Quit</code> 
  method.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You can start CATIA in batch to execute a macro using the -batch option
    followed by the full path of the macro you want to run: 
    <pre>CNEXT -batch -macro E:\Users\Macros\BatchMacro.CATScript</pre>
    this generally improves performances by avoiding visualization refreshes. 
  Any syntax of the <code>-macro</code> option can be used with the <code>-batch</code> option. 
   
  CATIA sessions launched this way will end by itself after the execution of 
  the macro.<p>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="OutProcess"></a>Running Out-process Macros</h3>
<p>Out-process access means that you run the macro from another application
running in another process, such as from Visual Basic for Applications
associated with products such as Excel or Word, or from Microsoft Visual Basic 5
Development Studio. You can also use the Windows Scripting Host to run VBScript
or JScript macros by simply double clicking the macro name from the Windows
desktop or Explorer, or from the command console. You can finally use VBScript
or JScript macros embedded in html pages.</p>
<p>The macro should first connect to CATIA to then access its data. This
connection starts CATIA if no CATIA process is being running. The script is
interpreted by the scripting engine hosted by the application from which you
start the macro.</p>
<p>You can run out-process macros with Windows only.</p>
<h4>Running Out-process Macros from VB 6 or VBA</h4>
<p>You can use the following syntax when using Visual Basic 6 
or Visual Basic for application</p>
<ul>
  <li>If CATIA is already running, the macro should simply connect to CATIA
    using the <b>GetObject</b> method 
    <pre><font color="#0000FF">Dim</font> CATIA <font color="#0000FF">As</font> Object<br>
    <font color="#0000FF">Set</font> CATIA = GetObject(, &quot;CATIA.Application&quot;)</pre>
    <p>The first argument is left blank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If CATIA is not already running, the macro should start CATIA using the <b>CreateObject</b>
    method 
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <pre><font color="#0000FF">Dim</font> CATIA <font color="#0000FF">As</font> Object<br>
    <font color="#0000FF">Set</font> CATIA = CreateObject(&quot;CATIA.Application&quot;)</pre>
    </blockquote>
<h4>Running Out-process Macros Using the Windows Scripting 
Host</h4>
<p>Another way is to use the Windows Scripting Host. This is a
language-independent scripting host which enables scripts written in different
languages such as Visual Basic, JScript, and Perl, to be run from the Windows
desktop, the Windows Explorer, or the command console.</p>
With Visual Basic, your script should begin by the connection to CATIA,
    using either CreateObject or GetObject, as follows: 
    <blockquote>
    <pre><font color="#0000FF">Dim</font> CATIA
<font color="#0000FF">Set</font> CATIA = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;CATIA.Application&quot;)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
    <blockquote>
    <pre><font color="#0000FF">Dim</font> CATIA
<font color="#0000FF">Set</font> CATIA = WScript.GetObject(&quot;&quot;, &quot;CATIA.Application&quot;)</pre>
  </blockquote>
<p>Note that the GetObject method requires that its first 
argument be blank.</p>
<p>To run the macros from the Windows desktop, simply double click on the macro
name. These names are suffixed using vbs for Visual Basic.</p>

<img border="0" src="images/CAAInfExplorer.jpg" width="734" height="484"> 
<p>To run the macros from the command console, use the <b>cscript</b> command as
follows:</p>
<pre>cscript e:\users\psr\Scripting\Sample\CATIA.vbs</pre>
<h4>Running Out-process Macros from a Dynamic HTML Page</h4>
<p>You can also run macros VBScript macros embedded in a html 
page. There are several ways of embedding a macro in a
html page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The macro is written using the script tag and run when the page is loaded</li>
  <li>The macro is written using the script tag and is included or referenced by
    a form, input, body, or a (anchor) tag.</li>
  <li>The macro is written using the a tag (anchor) and run as an hyperlink.
    This is possible with JScript only but a VBScript function can be called by 
  the JScript function.</li>
</ul>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Topological and geometric operators create new objects from existing
      ones. The modifications of the topological model can be logged into a
      journal. This article describes the features of the CGM journal and illustrates with examples of
      use. The way an
      operator writes items into the journal greatly influences the applications
      (such as Generic Naming and Part) that read this journal. It the reason
      why some examples of use are taken into the field of these applications,
      although these applications do not belong to the CGM offering.

<h3><a name="Definition"></a>Definition</h3>
<p>A topological operator operates on topological
objects to create new ones. Most of the time, these topological objects are
bodies (a body is a set of connected (or not) volumes, faces, edges and
vertices, see <a href="#References">[1]</a>). It never modifies the input
bodies: the resulting body is a new one, but it can share cells with the input
bodies, if they are not modified by the operation. This is called the smart
concept (see <a href="#References">[2]</a>). On request, the operator can
describe the way to go from the initial objects, to the resulting body. This
information is then put by each operator into a CGM journal.</p>
<p>The CGM journal records the creation, modification and deletion of the faces,
free edges and free vertices of topological objects. A free edge is an edge
bounding at most one face, and a free vertex is a vertex bounding at most one
edge. In fact, it is sufficient to follow the modifications of these cells to
know how the whole body has been modified. The journal is attached to any
topological or geometric operators that operate on topological objects.</p>
<p>The CGM journal is transient. You have to create it before its use and delete
it when you have finished. It is possible to compress it to easy its reading.</p>
<p>In addition to this article, you can find a dedicated use case <a href="#References">[3]</a>,
that illustrates the way to read the journal.</p>

<h4><a name="Structure"></a>Journal Structure</h4>
<p>The CGM journal is built as a composite pattern: a journal is a hierarchy of
<ul>
  <li><strong>item</strong>s, that are the leaves, and</li>
  <li><strong>list</strong>s of lists and items.</li>
</ul>
<table width="100%">

  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Item"></a>Item Structure</h4>
<p>An item is an elementary line of a journal, describing what happens for a
given cell.
<ul>
  <li>Each item has a type:<br>
    <dl>
      <dt>Creation</dt>
      <dd>A new cell appears in the resulting body, built from an (optional) set
        of cells of the input body.</dd>
      <dt>Deletion</dt>
      <dd>The cell disappears in the resulting body.</dd>
      <dt>Modification</dt>
      <dd>The cell that is used do not appear in the resulting body, and is
        replaced by a new one.</dd>
      <dt>Subdivision</dt>
      <dd>Kind of modification where the cell is cut in several parts that
        appear in the resulting body.</dd>
      <dt>Absorption</dt>
      <dd>Kind of modification where several cells are merged in the resulting
        body.</dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>An item points to the topological cells of the input bodies that have been
    modified, if any: in case of an absorption, several cells can be merged.</li>
  <li>An item points to the resulting topological cells: in case of a
    subdivision, several cells can appear.</li>
  <li>An item offers a field for an optional information, used by each operator
    to give additional details. This can be, as examples, the ribbon number for
    a fillet surface or the type of face (bottom, top, lateral) for a prism.
    Each operator publishes the way it uses the optional information.</li>
</ul>

      The face F1 of the pocket to be subtracted is modified and becomes the
      face D6 of the result.<br>
      The face F8 disappears in the result.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To clearly understand the difference between the creation and modification
type, let us take an example.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <caption>Fig. 2bis: Modification and creation items</caption>

    <td width="50%">
      <p>Imagine you first put a color attribute (red for exemple) on the face
      C1 of the initial Pad. After the pocket subtraction, you want that the
      faces D1 and D5 still have this red color. That is the meaning of the
      modification type.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Imagine now you have put a color on the curve C1 of the profile. You do
      not want that the faces F1, F5 and F6 still keeps this color: in fact,
      what could be the color of the face F5 and F6 if C1 were red and C2 were
      blue? That is the meaning of the creation item.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For each operator, the choice of the creation or modification type has been
designed according to the needs of the applications.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Copy or No Copy Mode"></a>Copy or No Copy Mode</h4>
<p>The copy or no copy mode is a default that the operator takes about the
writing of its journal. Take an empty journal as an input of an operator for
which you have asked to fill it.
<ul>
  <li>With the copy mode, the operator supposes that all the cells of the input
    bodies are in the resulting body. Let us consider the boolean union of two
    bodies, such that their intersection is empty. After such an union, if the
    union operator is in copy mode (and it fact, it is the way it does), nothing
    is written into the journal: according to the copy mode, all the cells are
    renewed by default, and none of them are modified. because the particular
    position of the two bodies.</li>
  <li>With the no copy mode, the operator supposes that none of the cells of the
    input bodies are in the resulting body. If you take the same union of the
    two non intersecting bodies and if the union operator worked in no copy
    mode, there would be as many creation item as there are faces, free vertices
    and edges in the two initial bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mode also has an influence on the item types that an operator uses to
write its items. In fact, in case of copy mode, the operator writes, in general,
more modification item type than it does in case of no copy mode. In case of no
copy mode, on the contrary, it uses more creation items. The copy and no-copy
mode as well as the detailed items is published by each operator.</p>

<h3><a name="Use"></a>Examples of Use</h3>
<p>We first describe the use of the topological journal for the object naming.
Then, we illustrate its use for the selection. The last part discusses on the
behavior differences between the creation and modification types. The journal is
written for the applications. It is the reason why these exemples are taken in
the field of applications to do not belong to the CGM offering.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Follow-up"></a>Naming</h4>
<p>The CGM journal makes it possible to build a logical identifier on the
generated cells.</p>
<p>Imagine that each curve of a profile has a logical name such as <tt>Curve1</tt>,
..., <tt>CurveN</tt>. Now, extrude the profile along a direction to build a pad.
The resulting face of the extrusion of the i-th curve of the profile can be
named, using the information of the corresponding topological operation, as <tt>Pad1_Lateral_From_CurveI</tt>.</p>
<p>Now, the user changes the definition of <tt>Curve_I</tt> (a circle radius, or
replaces the curve), but keeps it attached to the same label <tt>Curve_I</tt>.
If the prism operation is replayed, the result changes but all the logical names
remain the same. All information attached to a logical name is still available
on the new resulting body.</p>
<p>This principle is used by the Generic Naming to label the objects. In turn,
the object names are used by the feature applications to record the order of the
different topological operations. This is a main difference between the CGM
modeler and the Feature modeler: the Feature modeler records the history of the
operations, whereas the CGM modeler gives a transient information at the run of
the operator.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/TopoJournal3.gif" alt="TopoJournal3.gif (5047 bytes)" width="479" height="359"></td>
    <td>Following the items of the topological journal, the generic naming is
      able to propose logical names, such that a modification of a physical
      object (C2) attach to a logical name (<tt>Curve_2</tt>) does not modify
      the logical names of the derived objects (<tt>Pad1_lateral_From_Curve_2</tt>).
      Information attached to the logical objects are then stable if the
      operations are replayed in the same order.</td>

<h4><a name="Highlight">Selection</a></h4>
<p>Take the pad of <a href="#Fig. 3">Fig. 3</a> and split it by a plane as on <a href="#Fig. 4">Fig.
4</a>. It is possible to explore the CGM journal and go back from the last
created face G2 to the initial face of the Pad that has been modified. It is
then possible to have a way of selection which leads to the selection of the
initial Pad, by selecting a face of another topological object that has been
build from this Pad, which is useful when you want to modify a parameter of the
initial prism.</p>

<h4><a name="Influence of the creation or modification item type on the behavior of an operator"></a>Influence
of the Creation or Modification Item Type on the Behavior of an Operator</h4>
<p>On the CGM point on view, the choice of the creation or modification type
could have been arbitrary done. Now, this type acts on the behavior of the
operator, when it is replayed in a context of an application using the naming,
such as the mechanical modeler. So, the type has been chosen to lead to a
behavior as close as possible to the expectations of the applications.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <caption>Fig. 5: Influence of the creation or modification type: case of a
    pocket operation</caption>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/TopoJournal5.gif" alt="TopoJournal5.gif (8379 bytes)" width="479" height="359"></td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">Take first a pad, and fillet one of its edge.
      The faces H1 and H2 come from the modification of F1 and F2.
      <p>Now, insert a pocket operation just before the fillet operation, and
      replay the operations: pad, pocket, fillet</p>
      <p>* If the faces G1, G2 and G3 were stamped as created, it were not
      possible to go back to the initial faces, and the edges are not filleted.
      This behavior is not desired by the application, it is the reason why this
      choice is not taken for a Boolean operation.</p>
      <p>* On the contrary, if the faces G1, G2 and G3 are stamped as modified,
      it is possible to go back to the initial faces F1 and F2, and then
      filleting all the edges having F1 and F2 as ancestors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In this case, the application wants to keep the filleting of the resulting
edges, so that the pocket operation (a Boolean subtraction) stamped the faces as
modified. On the contrary, a shell operation is an example of creation mode.</p>
<table width="100%">
  <caption>Fig. 6: Influence of the creation or modification type: case of a
    shell operation</caption>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/TopoJournal6.gif" alt="TopoJournal6.gif (4372 bytes)" width="479" height="359"></td>
    <td width="50%">Take the filleted Pad of the preceeding example, and insert
      a shell operation instead of a pocket operation. The balloon shows how the
      shell operator operates: it blows the initial faces (such as F2) with a
      distance e1, leading to new faces (such as J2), and also shrinks the
      initial faces with a distance e2, leading to new faces (such as K2)
      <p>* If the faces J2 and K2 were stamped as modified from the face F2, the
      fillet operator would fillet them both, leading to potential impossible
      configurations. Moreover, it is not what is expected by the applications
      in this case.</p>
      <p>* So, the operator stamps them as created. The fillet operation is not
      replayed. If the user wants to have the face J2 filleted, it has to run a
      new fillet operation.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The creation or modification type modifies the behavior of the operator when
it is replayed on a slightly different configuration.</p>

<h3><a name="CGM Objectives"></a>CGM Objectives</h3>
<p>CATIA Geometric Modeler (CGM) is a complete software package for the
development of applications with a need for 3D geometric modeling capabilities,
and which want to take advantage of the power of the CATIA modeler and its
solid, surfacing and wireframe capabilities.</p>
<p>Provided as a set of object oriented programming ressources, it is composed
of a full set of high level geometric primitives, operations and queries, as
well as interfaces dedicated to the integration with other parts of an
application such as viewers, dialog monitors and data managers.</p>
<p>Designed in accordance to the major standards and the most recent design
patterns, it allows the best interoperability with other software components, a
great potential of growth and a possible customization.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="Architecture"></a>CGM Architecture</h3>
<p>The CGM modeler is delivered as a set of specialized components, called
frameworks, that are built on top of each other. They can be used stand-alone or
integrated with other CAA V5 applications.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Components"></a>CGM Frameworks</h4>
<p>Each framework provides either the application, or other frameworks with a
set of consistent services. The different frameworks cooperate to provide the
application with high level services. The hierarchy between the frameworks
allows an application which would like to only use a subset of CGM to minimize
the size of its prerequisites.</p>

    <td>This figure represents the tree of prerequisites and exposed services of
      the frameworks. For example, GeometricObjects uses as prerequisites some
      AdvancedMathematics exposed services.<br>
      Only direct arrows are drawn to simplify the figure. Hence,
      GeometricObjects also uses Mathematics exposed services.
      <p>Presented as a complete geometric and topological package, the CGM
      modeler can be used to develop powerful applications for building and
      operating complex geometry.</td>

    frameworks of the CGM offering, and provide basic mathematical services to
    many other applications.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><em>AdvancedMathematics</em></dt>
  <dd>offers a set of specific mathematical objects, such as N-dimensional
    intervals, NxM matrices, mathematical functions and systems of 1 or 2
    variables, implicit systems, and associated operations, dedicated to
    applications which need to perform<strong> intensive mathematical
    computations</strong>. The Mathematics and AdvancedMathematics objects are
    not persistent; they are used as intermediates by the other CGM frameworks.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><em>GeometricObjects</em></dt>
  <dd>provides the application with
    <ul>
      <li>an extensive set of <strong>basic geometric primitives</strong>, such
        as lines, conics, NURBS curves and surfaces, fillet surfaces.</li>
      <li>general mechanisms of <strong>the object management</strong>: creation
        and delete of a set containing the CGM objects, object creation and
        removal, object checking, stream (conversion of the objects in memory
        into a sequence of bytes to be later stored on a given media) and
        unstream, read and write on disk, persistent references.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The geometric objects are used to define the supporting geometry for
    higher level objects, such as topological objects for instance. The C2
    continuity is assumed for all geometric object.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><em>GeometricOperators</em></dt>
  <dd>provides the <strong>operators</strong> on GeometricObjects such as
    intersection, projection, reflect lines, mathematical analysis. It uses the

  <dt><em>TopologicalObjects</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>defines all manifold and non-manifold <strong>topological objects</strong>.
        A topological object provides a full boundary representation by explicit
        definition of its boundaries.</li>
      <li>provides<strong> tools for the navigation</strong> through the
        topological graph and for <strong>the check</strong> of its logical
        consistency.</li>

    <p>This framework uses GeometricObjects for the supporting geometry
    definition and can be used by applications in need for B-Rep topology
    representations.</p>

      <li>triangular mesh,</li>
      <li>outlines.</li>
    </ul>

    machines and quick interference analysis.</p>

<h4><a name="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h4>
<p>CGM offers a large scale of use:
<ul>
  <li>The first level allows<strong> </strong>you<strong> to consult the
    geometric and topological objects</strong> that are already built. This
    level corresponds to the need of applications such as numerical control,
    finite element analysis, or data transfer to STEP or IGES format.</li>
  <li>At a second level, CGM provides resources <strong>to create geometric and
    topological objects</strong> for applications such as mechanical part
    design.</li>
  <li>At the most specialized level, the CGM core is enhanced by <strong>applications</strong>
    (such as free form or geodesic applications) <strong>providing powerful
    tools for building and operating complex surfaces</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Opening"></a>Openness</h4>
<p>The architecture of the CGM modeler is designed to be open. Hence, if an
application programmer wants to put additional information on existing objects,
attributes are provided. Moreover, a mechanism is provided to define foreign
surfaces or curves and use them as any CGM surface or curve.
<dl>
  <dt><em>Attributes</em></dt>
  <dd>CGM allows an application developer to associate typed data with geometric
    or topological objects, without creating a new class. This additional data
    is called a CGM attribute. The attributes can be streamed. They are very
    useful to store temporary data produced by an algorithm, such as, for
    example:
    <ul>
      <li>stamps on objects during model scans.</li>
      <li>processed data relative to an object: extraction of the meshing.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><em>Defining a foreign geometry</em></dt>
  <dd>CGM allows an application programmer to introduce his own class of curve
    or surface A generic development frame is provided, to fully integrate the
    foreign class in the general CGM architecture, and uses the foreign class
    instances as any CGM curve or surface instances.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><em>Defining a new operator</em></dt>
  <dd>In matter of operators, the application programmer can define a new
    operator by creating a new class.</dd>
</dl>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Integration"></a>Integration in the General V5 Offering</h4>
<p>The CGM modeler can be used stand-alone or as a component of the general V5
offering.</p>
<p>The CGM objects are created inside a CGM container, which is a set of CGM
objects. This container must be complete: when a CGM object is inside the
container, all the CGM objects that are referred by it must also be inside the
same container.</p>
<p>In particular, topological and geometric operators work on objects of a same
container: the input and output objects must belong to the same container.</p>
<p>To store the CGM container, the application puts it in its own document.</p>
<p>Applications which are not owner of any document, but want to store their
data, can use a .NCGM document, delivered by the CGM offering.</p>

<h3><a name="Functionalities"></a>CGM Functionality</h3>
<p>CGM provides a geometric and topological modeler and general mechanisms to
interact with this modeler.</p>
<h4><a name="Modeler"></a>A Geometric and Topological Modeler</h4>
<p>The <strong>geometric part of the modeler</strong> allows the user to create
and use <strong>an extensive set of geometric primitives</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>point, point on curve, point on surface</li>
  <li>curves: line, circle, conic, spline curve, NURBS curve</li>
  <li>curves on surface: line, circle, conic, spline curve, NURBS curve lying on
    a surface.</li>
  <li>surfaces: plane, cone, sphere, torus, cylinder, NURBS surface, revolution
    surface, ruled surface, offset surface, fillet surface, draft surface,
    chamfer surface</li>
</ul>
<p>These geometric objects must be C2 continuous.</p>
<p>The provided <strong>geometric operations</strong> are:
<ul>
  <li>Intersection of two curves, a curve and a surface, two surfaces</li>
  <li>Projection of a point on a curve or a surface, of a curve on a surface</li>
  <li>Reflect lines</li>
  <li>Connection between two surfaces</li>
  <li>Determination of the minimum distance between two curves, a curve and a
    surface, a point and a curve, a point and a surface, two surfaces</li>
  <li>Search of the confusion between 2 curves, two points on curve, two points
    on surface</li>
  <li>Search of the inclusion of a point in a curve or a surface, a curve in
    another curve or a surface</li>
  <li>Local analysis at a point of a curve or a surface</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>topological part of the modeler</strong> defines an object from
its <strong>boundary representation</strong>: <em>vertice</em>s bound <em>edges</em>,
that bound <em>faces</em>, that bound <em>volumes</em>. The highest level of
topological objects is called a<em> body</em>.
<ul>
  <li>1D-bodies represent wire objects.</li>
  <li>2D-bodies represent shell objects.</li>
  <li>3D-bodies represent solid objects.</li>
  <li>Bodies of mixed dimensions, leading to a case of <em>non-manifold</em>
    bodies, can also be represented, as well as any kind of manifold and
    non-manifold configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topological modeler is based on the <strong>cell complexes theory</strong>
(see Rossignac and O'Connor [<a href="#References">1</a>]). This approach
presents a lot of advantages such as:
<ul>
  <li>To manage all the dimensions in a unified way</li>
  <li>To handle all cases of manifold and non-manifold bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topological operations build new bodies. The following operators are
provided:
<ul>
  <li>Boolean operations: union, intersection, subtract</li>
  <li>Transformation</li>
  <li>Draft operation</li>
  <li>Fillet operation</li>
  <li>Chamfer operation</li>
  <li>Shell operation</li>
  <li>Sweep operation</li>
  <li>Thickness operation</li>
  <li>Split operation</li>
  <li>Reflect operation</li>
  <li>Creation of prism</li>
  <li>Creation of revolute</li>
  <li>Intersection with a curve or a surface</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, CGM contains advanced topological operators for surface modeling,
especially powerful for body in white or surface styling applications:
<ul>
  <li>Sweep with one or more profiles, along a spine or between two rails, with
    various laws of angle or radius definition</li>
  <li>Blend with a G1 or G2 joining, fillet blend</li>
  <li>Topological extrapolation</li>
  <li>Loft with various mixing laws</li>
  <li>Match of a face to be in G0, G1 or G2 continuity with another one</li>
  <li>Fitting of a face on a set of geometries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topological modeler implements the <strong>smart concept</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>Once accepted, a body is never modified: the body is called <em>frozen</em>.</li>
  <li>Bodies are allowed to share geometry and topology.<br>
    Hence, a topological operation does not modify a body; it creates a new
    resulting body, that potentially shares geometry or topology with the
    initial one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps leading to a new topological body can be written in a <strong>topological
journal</strong>.This information, depending on each operator, is temporary and
helps the CGM programmer to follow the objects modifications. This capability
provides the key mechanisms that are used by applications (such as the
mechanical modeler) to implement a full feature modeling approach</p>
<p><strong>What About Units?</strong><br>
The unit of the container is the millimeter. Moreover, the maximum size of an
object, called <em>model size</em>, is given by the container. Its value is
fixed to 1km (10^5mm=100m before R14). This determines the <em>resolution</em> of the model or
minimum size of valid objects. This size is 10^-3mm. The angle unit is the
radian.</p>
<p><strong>...and Tolerant Modeling?:</strong><br>
The objects are built as hermetic as possible, that is to say, with the as
small as possible gap.<br>
The operators, on the contrary, must support gaps as large as possible, because
the modeler has to be able to use external objects or because the user does not
want to be so precise. It is the reason why there is no maximum gap.<br>
The resolution defines the minimum size of the valid objects. In particular,
this defines the criterion of geometric coiencidence. But the mathematical
computations (such as intersection, projection) work at a numerical tolerance,
which is much more precise.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Application"></a>Building an Application</h4>
<p>CGM provides as a separate software component a set of classes and methods
for the creation and use of geometric and topological objects such as to operate
them, analyze their geometric properties, modify their definition or update
them.</p>
<p>All the CGM objects can be used by viewers or dialog monitors, defining a
wide range of applications. We describe now some general mechanisms for
interacting with the CGM modeler.
<dl>
  <dt><em>Subscript/Subscribe</em></dt>
  <dd>This mechanism allows an application to subscribe to a modification of the
    CGM objects. The application is then informed as soon as a modification
    occurs, and can launch specific treatments. The refresh of the visualization
    after the modification of an object is an example of use of such
    functionality.</dd>
  <dt><em>Undo/Redo</em></dt>
  <dd>Using the smart mechanism, <em>undo</em> actions can be put in place on
    the topological objects. An <em>undo</em> action restore the model in the
    state it was at the last stamp. A <em>redo</em> action cancel the previous <em>undo</em>
    action.</dd>
  <dt><em>Streaming and unstreaming</em></dt>
  <dd>In order to be saved on disk or to be included inside another file, the
    CGM objects are able to be converted in a sequence of bytes (this operation
    is called <em>streaming</em>); conversely, such sequence of bytes can be
    transformed into a CGM model (<em>unstreaming</em>).</dd>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>To convey end user intents to the object that can do the requested job,
      CAA V5 uses specific objects called commands that build a tree structure.
      Events issued by the end user are converted into CAA V5 notifications that
      are sent from command to command upwards in the command tree structure
      until a command executes the job. A given command can send notifications,
      and when receiving one, it can either be transparent to, enrich, or
      process the received notification, depending on the notification type and
      the command purpose.

<h3><a name="100000"></a>How It Works</h3>
<p>The send/receive communication protocol uses the <code>SendNotification</code>,
<code>AnalyseNotification</code>, and <code>ReceiveNotification</code> methods
of the CATCommand class, and sends notifications along the command tree
structure to perform the event propagation from the command that detected the
event to the command that can process it.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysSendReceive1.gif" alt="CAASysSendReceive1.gif (6839 bytes)" width="584" height="257"></p>
<p>The command 1 receives the system event as a CAA V5 notification, instance of
the CATNotification class. It sends the notification to its father, the command
2, using the CATCommand's <code>SendNotification</code> method:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>SendNotification(MyFather, Notification);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each command knows its father by means of a pointer stored as a private data
member and passed as an input parameter of the command constructor.</p>
<p>This command 2 is not designed to process events, that is it does not
override the <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method. Thus the CATCommand's <code>AnalyseNotification</code>
method is used and returns <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code> to the command
1 which then resends the notification to the command 3, father of the command 2
in the command tree structure. This command 3 is designed to process such events
and overrides the <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method to catch that expected
notification by returning <code>CATNotifDontTransmitToFather</code> to the
sending command 1 which stops the event propagation. Otherwise, it returns <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code>,
thus leaving this notification goes on propagating. Depending on what the
command 3 developer intends to do, two possibilities exist:
<ol>
  <li>Process the notification from the end user standpoint, that is perform the
    user intent. To do this, the <code>SendCommandSpecificObject</code> method
    can be overridden, and used possibly several times, to query about the
    object(s) involved.</li>
  <li>Enrich the notification, that is creates a new notification that can be
    processed by another command above in the tree structure and send it to its
    father or directly to this specific command if it is known. The <code>SendNotification</code>
    first parameter allows for this. In this case, pay attention to a possible
    loop between the sending command and the target command.</li>
</ol>
<p>If no command is found, the root command is reached. This root command, a
CATCommandSelector instance, plays a specific role. When it receives a
notification, meaning that no command below in the command tree structure path,
from the command which first receives the event and the CATCommandSelector
instance, has been able to process the event, it sends back the notification to
the active dialog command. This active dialog command can then decide what to
do. The figure below shows the command tree structure and the event propagation
along it.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysSendReceive2.gif" alt="CAASysSendReceive2.gif (7287 bytes)" width="601" height="364"></p>
<p>Once the appropriate receiving command is reached, a dialog can begin between
this receiving command and the sending command, to get more information about
the event, that is generally which object is concerned with the event. In its <code>AnalyseNotification</code>
method, the receiving command requests the sending command for that object,
beginning with the expected type(s). The sending command returns that object if
the type is matched, or <code>NULL</code> otherwise. The receiving command can
then loop on all the types it expects until whether an object is returned, or
the type list end is reached.</p>
<p>The CATCommand's <code>SendObject</code> method is used by the receiving
command against the sending command to ask for an object type, and this <code>SendObject</code>
method calls the sending command's <code>SendCommandSpecificObject</code>
method, if this one exists, to return the expected object, or returns <code>NULL</code>
otherwise.</p>
<p>Below is an OMT-like figure that shows the main objects and methods used.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysSendReceive3.gif" alt="CAASysSendReceive3.gif (5131 bytes)" width="655" height="327"></p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="200000"></a>What Should I Do?</h3>
<p>As soon as you intend to create a command, you should know if your command is
transparent for notifications, that is leave notifications pass through it, is a
sending command, process some of the possible notifications that can reach it,
and/or enrich some of them.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="210000"></a>My Command Is Transparent for Notifications</h4>
<p>This is the case, for example, of some intermediate dialog objects that
contains others, such as a frame in a window that contains a graphic viewer. The
frame is an instance of a class which derives from CATCommand, as well as the
viewer it contains, and as well as the window that contains both. The frame is
there to accommodate the viewer, but has no real possibilities regarding the
user intents, and is thus transparent for notifications.</p>
<p>In this case, you have nothing to do. The CATCommand class instance created
when your command is instantiated provides your command with this transparent
behavior, takes care of receiving the notifications, and replies always <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code>
to the sending command.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="220000"></a>My Command Is a Sending Command</h4>
<p>Your command detects a user intent, and plays the role of converting the
system event into a CAA V5 notification. This notification is sent thanks to the
CATCommand's method <code>SendNotification</code> you can use as is.</p>
<p>In this case, you have nothing to do. The CATCommand class instance created
when your command is instantiated provides your command with this transparent
behavior, takes care of receiving the notifications, and replies always <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code>
to the sending command.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>SendNotification(MyFather, Notification);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>But this is generally not enough. If the user intent is valid in the current
context, that is can be turned into a task that an available command can
perform, and if this command is reached by the notification, sure this command
will request more information from your sending command using the <code>SendObject</code>
method. To reply, your sending command must override the <code>SendCommandSpecificObject</code>
method called by the <code>SendObject</code> method. This method should return a
pointer to the object belonging to the requested class and managed by your
command, and <code>NULL</code> otherwise.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>void * SendCommandSpecificObject(
           const char      * ClassOfExpectedObject,
           CATNotification * Notification)
{
  if (TheObjectIManage-&gt;IsAKindOf(ClassOfExpectedObject)
    return ((void *) TheObjectIManage);
  else
    return NULL;
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Of course, you can loop on the different objects you command manages, if any.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="230000"></a>My Command Processes Some Notifications</h4>
<p>Your command is there to process some user intents, and you need to code what
to do when the end user asks to do what your command expects. Two ways are
offered:
<ol>
  <li>Override the <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method to code or call the
    appropriate methods that perform the job</li>
  <li>Set a callback on notification reception, for the notification you expect,
    by means of the <code>AddAnalyseNotificationCB</code> method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both can be used in the same command, but not for the same notification,
since the callback is searched for first.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5>Overriding the AnalyseNotification Method</h5>
<p>You simply need to catch the notifications you expect, and resend the others.
A skeleton for such a overridden <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method could
be:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CATNotifPropagationMode MyCommand::AnalyseNotification
         (CATCommand* SendingCommand,
          CATNotification* ReceivedNotification)
{
  if (ReceivedNotification-&gt;IsAKindOf(      // Catch expected notifications
                 ExpectedNotification::ClassName())
  {

  // provide here the code to process the notification
  
    return (CATNotifDontTransmitToFather);
  }
  else                                         // Resend the others
    return (CATNotifTransmitToFather);
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In this skeleton, <code>SendingCommand</code> is the command that sends the
notification named <code>ReceivedNotification</code>. If this <code>ReceivedNotification</code>
is an instance of the ExpectedNotification class, or of one of its derived
classes, then you can process <code>ReceivedNotification</code>, and stops the
notification propagation by returning <code>CATNotifDontTransmitToFather</code>.
Otherwise, leave the notification propagation goes on by returning <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code>.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h5>Setting Callbacks on Notification Reception</h5>
<p>You can set a callback for each expected notification, for example in the
command constructor, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
AddAnalyseNotificationCB(                      // Set the callback for the
          ExpectedSendingCommand,              // expected notifications
          ExpectedNotification,
          (CATCommandMethod)&amp;MyCommand::MethodToCallBack,
          PointerToUsefulData);
...

MyCommand::MethodToCallBack(                   // Code the callback
          CATCommand* ExpectedSendingCommand,
          CATNotification * ExpectedNotification,
          CATCommandClientData PointerToUsefulData) {

// provide here the code to process the notification

}
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Setting a callback, and providing the method for the callback, stops the
notification propagation along the command tree structure.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h5>Requesting an Object To Be Sent</h5>
<p>If your command requests input from the end user, such as the object selected
under the mouse, use the <code>SendObject</code> method to request the sending
command, which should know this object, to send it to your command, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
SendObject(ClassOfExpectedObject, Notification);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>where <code>ClassOfExpectedObject</code> is the class from which the object
you expect is an instance, and <code>Notification</code> the notification which
reaches your command.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="240000"></a>My Command Enriches Some Notifications</h4>
<p>You may want to add information to a received notification without processing
it by your command. In this case, you can either override the <code>AnalyseNotification</code>
method, or set a callback, as described above, but instead of processing the
notification, you instantiate a new notification and you send it to the
appropriate command, generally the father of your command.</p>
<p>The following code should then be inserted in the code skeleton above in
place of the comment for processing the notification.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
MyEnrichedNotification = new CATEnrichedNotification();
SendNotification(Father, MyEnrichedNotification);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="300000"></a>A Send/Receive Example</h3>
<p>This example relies on the following command tree:</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysSendReceive4.gif" alt="CAASysSendReceive4.gif (5994 bytes)" width="598" height="270"></p>
<p>The command 1 detects an end user intent and converts it as a notification
sent along the command tree structure. The command 2 is transparent for
notifications, and the notification reaches the command selector which resends
it to the active dialog command. This command expects such notification, and
request from the sending command 1 an expected object to be sent.</p>
<p>The first step is for the command 1 to send the notification. This is coded
as follows in the appropriate method, that is the one which turns the system
event into a CAA V5 notification:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
  CATNotification* NotifToSend = new MyNotification();
  SendNotification (GetFather(), NotifToSend);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The appropriate notification is instantiated, and sent to the command's
father. Note that this father can be retrieved using the <code>GetFather</code>
method.</p>
<p>Then the notification goes along the command tree structure. It meets the
command 2 which has not overridden the <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method
and which uses the CATCommand's <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method to
return <code>CATTransmitToFather</code> to the command 1. Since this father is
the command selector, the notification propagation stops and is sent by this
command selector to the command 3, the active dialog command. This command has
overridden the <code>AnalyseNotification</code> method as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CATNotifPropagationMode Command3::AnalyseNotification
       (CATCommand* SendingCommand,
        CATNotification* ReceivedNotification)
{
  if (ReceivedNotification-&gt;IsAKindOf(
                 ExpectedNotification::ClassName())
  {
    ExpectedObject* TheExpectedObject = (ExpectedObject*)
    SendingCommand-&gt;SendObject(
      ExpectedObject::ClassName(), ReceivedNotification);
    if (TheExpectedObject)
      return (CATNotifDontTransmitToFather);
    else
      return (CATNotifTransmitToFather);
  }
  else
    return (CATNotifTransmitToFather);
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The active command knows the notification it expects, and the method compares
its class to the one of the received notification. If the two classes match, it
creates an expected object instance and request from the sending command to such
object using the <code>SendObject</code> method. If the expected object is
returned, the method returns successfully with <code>CATNotifDontTransmitToFather</code>,
and with <code>CATNotifTransmitToFather</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>The sending command should have overridden the <code>SendCommandSpecificObject</code>
as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>void *Command1::SendCommandSpecificObject(
                  const char * ExpectedObject,
                  CATNotification* ReceivedNotification)
{
  if ( _TheHandledObject-&gt;IsAKindOf(ExpectedObject) &amp;&amp;
       (ReceivedNotification == _NotifSent) )
      return ((void *) _TheHandledObject);
    else
      return (NULL);
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>SendCommandSpecificObject</code> method has the same arguments than
the <code>SendObject</code> method. The sending command has keep track of the
notification sent, for example in the <code>_NotifSent</code> data member, and
handles <code>_TheHandledObject</code> instance. If the class of which <code>_TheHandledObject</code>
is an instance is a kind of the ExpectedObject class, that is the two classes
are the same or <code>_TheHandledObject</code>'s class derives from the
ExpectedObject class, <code>_TheHandledObject</code> is returned, and is also
returned by the calling <code>SendObject</code> command as <code>TheExpectedObject</code>
pointer to the active dialog command, which can now uses it appropriately.
Otherwise, <code>NULL</code> is returned.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>The CAA V5 commands build a tree structure whose root command is the
CATCommandSelector instance. The Send/Receive communication protocol enables a
notification sent by one of these commands to propagate up to the appropriate
command, that is the command able to execute the job requested by the
notification.</p>
<p>Each command on top of the sending command can in turn either participate to
the notification propagation or process the notification. If the root command is
reached, it sends the notification to the active command which can decide to
process the notification, or to stop its propagation.</p>

<h3><a name="50000"></a>What Are CAA V5 Interfaces?</h3>
<p>Object-oriented design and related object-oriented languages such as C++
allow the application programmer to describe and code real objects as classes
tha include a structural part, the data members, and a behavioral part, the
member functions, or methods. With C++, the classes are instantiated using their
constructors and the application programmer who uses the classes can reference
the data members and the methods declared as public, and can also use the data
members and the methods declared as protected when deriving the classes to build
new ones. This is a very nice object-oriented feature, but when the header file
of a class changes, even if only the private part changes, all the applications
that include this file must be rebuilt.</p>
<p>A more generic way to design objects is to see them through their behavior
only, and to describe this behavior by means of methods only: this provides
interfaces to grasp the object. For the application programmer, the interface is
the only visible part of an object that hides the details of its implementation
which are totally under the responsibility of the class provider.</p>
<p>The interface constitutes a contract between the framework class developer
and the application programmer. This contract includes the object from the real
world to work on, the methods to use to manipulate these objects and how to call
these methods. This should not change with the time. Only additions are allowed,
and the applications developed on top of the framework should never been rebuilt
due to framework modifications.</p>
<p>Implementing an interface is the way the framework class developer meets the
contract. It is his/her own business to choose the most appropriate technology,
and possibly to switch from one technology to another when necessary without
impact for the applications.</p>
<p>A supplied interface should not change with the time. A supplied
implementation of an interface should also continue to implement the unchanged
interface without modification for the client application with the time. If
modifications are required, such as new method signatures, a new interface must
be supplied. If other interfaces must be implemented, existing implementations
should not change, and CAA V5 provides means to extend them without impact for
the client application.</p>
<p>The needs that suit the interface and implementation separation are the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encapsulation: an object exposes only handles to manipulate it, not its
    internal mechanisms that carry out the manipulations.</li>
  <li>Polymorphism: objects which share the same interface can be treated by an
    application in the same way, even if these objects implements this interface
    in different ways.</li>
  <li>Inheritance: objects that have common interfaces can be said as kind of a
    base object that expose these common interfaces. These objects derive from
    the base object and inherit its inter-faces.</li>
  <li>build independence: the coupling between the applications and the
    frameworks they use should be as weak as possible. The applications know
    only the interfaces of the frameworks, and the implementation modifications
    do not require to rebuild the applications.</li>
  <li>Framework open architecture: it should be possible for a customer to
    implement framework interfaces and to add new interfaces to existing
    implementations.</li>
  <li>Multiple implementation: a framework with a given interface should be able
    to associate several implementations with this interface. This multiple
    implementation can be static (sequential) or dynamic (simultaneous). The
    static multiple implementation means that the current implementation
    switches at a given time for another which for example matches a new
    technology. The dynamic multiple implementation allows for several
    implementations to coexist simultaneously and allows to switch from one
    implementation to another at user&#8217;s request.</li>
  <li>Distributed object architecture: the object instances of a framework
    should be able of being handled by an object server running in a different
    process, possibly on another node, than the process which runs the client
    application, possibly through an object request broker which sends requests
    for the objects to the remote object server.</li>

<h3><a name="100000"></a>A Sample Interface</h3>
<p>A CATIA interface is created as a C++ abstract class. It thus contains only
pure virtual methods. It is made of a header file, a source file, and a TIE
file.
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="110000"></a>The Interface Header File</h4>
<p>Here is how the <em>CAAIXX</em> CATIA interface header file looks like:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#ifndef CAAIXX_h
#define CAAIXX_h

#include &quot;CATBaseUnknown.h&quot;

extern ExportedByCAADLL IID IID_CAAIXX;

class ExportedByCAADLL CAAIXX : public CATBaseUnknown
{
  CATDeclareInterface;
  public :
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall MXX1() = 0;
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall MXX2(CATBaseUnknown * pUnk) = 0;
};

#endif</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The role of each statement is depicted below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CAASysInterfaceHeader.jpg" width="601" height="297"></p>
<p>These roles are:
<ul>
  <li>The <code>#ifndef</code>, <code>#define</code>, and <code>#endif</code>
    preprocessor directives protect the header file from multiple inclusion.</li>
  <li>The <em>CATBaseUnknown</em> header file is included because the <em>CAAIXX</em>
    interface is an abstract class that C++-derives from <em>CATBaseUnknown</em></li>
  <li>Any interface can be recognized thanks to an identifier declared as a
    global extern variable. This identifier must be unique, and will be
    initialized in the interface source file</li>
  <li>The interface class must derive from <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>, or from
    another interface class. Multiple inheritance is not available, according to
    CATIA rules</li>
  <li>The macro <code>CATDeclareInterface</code> declares that this class is a
    CATIA interface</li>
  <li>The methods features the following:
    <ul>
      <li>All methods must be public, since any interface method is intended to
        be implemented</li>
      <li>They must be pure virtual, that is, the interface class doesn't
        provide any implementation of these methods</li>
      <li>They must return a HRESULT [<a href="#References">1</a>]. This is a
        standard Microsoft return code used to make interfaces OLE compliant</li>
      <li>They must use the __stdcall calling convention [<a href="#References">2</a>].
        This is a Microsoft extension to the C++ compiler also used to make
        interfaces OLE compliant</li>
      <li>They can have parameters that are usually pointers to other
        interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="120000"></a>The Interface Source File</h4>
<p>The <em>CAAIXX</em> interface source file is as follows.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CAAIXX.h&#8220;

IID IID_CAAIXX = {
  0x7c1b4ba8,
  0x5c25,
  0x0000,
&nbsp; {0x02, 0x80, 0x02, 0x0b, 0xcb, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00} };

CATImplementInterface(CAAIXX, CATBaseUnknown);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The role of each statement is depicted below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CAASysInterfaceSource.jpg" width="441" height="182"></p>
<p>These roles are:
<ul>
  <li>The <em>CAAIXX</em> header file is included to retrieve the IID
    declaration, and the <em>CATBaseUnknown</em> header file inclusion</li>
  <li>The interface IID is initialized to a worldwide and lasting unique value.
    It is also called GUID, for Global Unique IDentifier [<a href="#References">3</a>]</li>
  <li>The macro <code>CATImplementInterface</code> declares that <em>CAAIXX</em>
    OM-derives from <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>. Interfaces must always OM-derive
    from <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pure virtual functions are of course not implemented in the classes which
declare them as pure.</p>
<p>Among the methods of <code>CATIXX</code>, three methods inherited from the
interface <code>IUnknown</code>, from which derives the class <code>CATBaseUnknown</code>,
play a particular role for an interface:
<ol>
  <li><code>QueryInterface</code> returns a pointer to an interface from another
    pointer to another interface implemented by the same object</li>
  <li><code>AddRef</code> adds a reference to a counter for this interface</li>
  <li><code>Release</code> removes the reference from the counter.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>QueryInterface</code> allows for navigation among the interfaces
implemented by a component, while <code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code>
allow for component life cycle management [<a href="#References">4</a>].</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="130000"></a>The Interface TIE</h4>
<p>The third file to create requests that the interface TIE be generated by the
code builder mkmk. This file is the TIE_CAAIXX.tsrc file that simply contains an
include statement to the CAAIXX.h file:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CAAIXX.h&quot;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The TIEs is not part of the object model concepts. It is a necessary
implementation detail. To separate interfaces from their implementations, a TIE
object instance is created at run time as an intermediary object that makes the
link between the component that uses the interface and thus holds a pointer to
this interface, and the component that implements the interface, that is, that
contains the code to run the methods declared by the interface. The interface
pointer is in fact a pointer to a TIE object instance returned by the <code>QueryInterface</code>
method. The TIE object redirects the interface method calls to the component
that implements the interface.</p>
<p>The TIE file is by default created in the ProtectedGenerated folder, whatever 
the interface header file location. To 
create it in the PublicGenerated folder, add the //public keyword in the tsrc 
file, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CAAIXX.h&quot;
//public</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top">Top</a></p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="200000"></a>IUnknown and CATBaseUnknown</h3>
<p>The base class for all interfaces and for all classes that implement
interfaces is <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>, a class provided by CATIA. <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>
derives from the <em>IUnknown</em> interface, supplied by CATIA for UNIX and by
the Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) for Windows. The <em>IUnknown</em>
interface is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>interface IUnknown
{
  virtual HRESULT __stdcall QueryInterface(const IID&amp; iid, void** ppv) = 0;
  virtual ULONG __stdcall AddRef() = 0;
  virtual ULONG __stdcall Release() = 0;
};</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Among the methods of <em>CAAIXX</em>, these three methods inherited from the
interface <em>IUnknown</em> play a particular role:
<ol>
  <li><code>QueryInterface</code> returns a pointer to an interface from another
    pointer to another interface implemented by the same component</li>
  <li><code>AddRef</code> adds a reference to a counter for this interface</li>
  <li><code>Release</code> removes the reference from the counter.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>QueryInterface</code> allows for navigation among the interfaces
implemented by a component, while <code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code>
allow for component life cycle management.</p>
<p>The <em>IUnknown</em> interface supplied by CATIA is exactly the same that
the one of COM, making interfaces portable from UNIX to Windows and the reverse.</p>
<p><em>CATBaseUnknown</em> provides an implementation for the methods <code>QueryInterface</code>,
<code>AddRef</code> and <code>Release</code>, exposed as pure virtual functions
by <em>IUnknown</em>, avoiding to implement them whenever you implement an
interface and thus contributing to code factorization.</p>
<p>All interfaces can be seen as <em>IUnknown</em> interfaces, that is a pointer
to <em>IUnknown</em> can be used for each of them . This allows the client
application to request from such an <em>IUnknown</em> pointer if the
implementing component supports other interfaces and prevents the client
application to manage pointers to those implementing objects, managing only
pointers to interfaces.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>CATIA interfaces as created as C++ absract classes deriving from <em>CATBaseUnknown</em>.
The interface TIE makes the link at run time between the component that uses the
interface and the component that implements it.</p>
<p>The interface is a contract between the interface developer, the provider of
the component that implements the interface, and the client application
programmer who uses the component. The interface should not change with the
time, and the client applications which use these interfaces never need to be
rebuilt when a new version of the code which contains the interface
implementations is installed.</p>

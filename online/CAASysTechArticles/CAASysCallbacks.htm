      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>The callback mechanism is the way CAA V5 implements publish/subscribe
      between objects. An object can play the role of an event publisher to warn
      other objects which have subscribed for that object to call them whenever
      a given event happens. The base class for event publishers and for event
      subscribers are <strong>CATBaseUnknown</strong> and <strong>CATEventSubscriber</strong>.
      Other types of callbacks exist for specific events, such as returning in
      the main loop for onidle callbacks, exceeding a given time for timeout
      callbacks, or modifying a file descriptor for file descriptor callbacks.

<h3><a name="100000"></a>What Is the Callback Mechanism?</h3>
<p>The callback mechanism offers the publish/subscribe capability. Let's remind
what's the matter by means of a comparison taken from the daily life.</p>
<p>When a newspaper issues, it publishes news for all the newspaper's readers,
who can be classified into those who buy the newspaper every day, and those who
receive it at home because they have subscribed to it. Each time the newspaper
issues, a specific team mails the newspaper to the subscribers. This team also
manages the subscriber list, records new subscribers, and deletes those who
revoke their subscription or who do not pay their subscription fees when the
subscription period is over.</p>
<p>The callback mechanism is very near. An object (the newspaper company) can
publish an event (the news), by means of a notification (the newspaper issue).
This object requests its callback manager (the mailing team), to dispatch the
notification to all the subscribers. A subscriber subscribes for a given event
published by a given object, and the subscriber list is managed by the
publishing object's callback manager.</p>
<p>Note that in the real life, an object can be a publisher for certain events,
and a subscriber for others. For example, a member of the newspaper company can
subscribe to other newspapers or magazines. This is also the case with CAA V5
and with your client applications.</p>

<h3><a name="200000"></a>Making an Object an Event Publisher and/or Subscriber</h3>
<p>There are two ways of making an object an event publisher and/or subscriber:
<ol>
  <li>The most simple and common way is to derive from CATBaseUnknown. Global
    functions allow for subscribers to subscribe and remove subscriptions, and
    for publishers a default callback manager implemented as an extension of the
    CATBaseUnknown class processes the dispatch without you need to worry about.
    <strong>This is recommended way for most publish/subscribe usages</strong>.</li>
  <li>Another way for advanced usages is to derive the publisher or the
    subscriber class, or both, from the CATEventSubscriber class. This allows,
    for example, an object to set a callback in place of another object if the
    latter derives from CATEventSubscriber, and also to override the publishing
    and subscribing methods to add your specific tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="300000"></a>Deriving from CATBaseUnknown</h4>
<p>This is the way you should use in most cases. To illustrate how to do, let's
take the following example. Assume that your apartment is protected using an
alarm that rings when a burglar attempts to enter when you are not there. In the
daily life, the alarm notifies the burglar with the emitted sound that he should
not stay here, and usually the burglar runs away. Maybe he knows how to
neutralize the alarm, but this is another story.</p>
<p>With this scenario, we have an event publisher, the alarm, and an event
subscriber, the burglar. The alarm publishes the event &quot;I am
triggered&quot; by means of the notification: &quot;the sound emitted&quot;. The
burglar has few to do to subscribe to this event, since his ears do this for
him. In our object world, instances of burglars have no ears and to make them
advised burglars, we need to make them subscribe to such events if they don't
want to be captured. In this case, we also need to design police objects, but
this is also another story.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysCallback1.gif" alt="CAASysCallback1.gif (5612 bytes)" width="622" height="263"></p>
<p>This is how to create such objects, and make it run together:
<ol>
  <li>Create the publisher: the ApartmentAlarm class. It derives from the
    CATBaseUnknown class and has a <code>BeginRinging</code> method:
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>#include &quot;CATBaseUnknown.h&quot;

class ApartmentAlarm : public CATBaseUnknown
{
  CATDeclareClass;
  public:
    ApartmentAlarm();
    virtual ~ApartmentAlarm();
    void BeginRinging();
};</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Create the published notification: the AlarmRinging class. It derives from
    the CATNotification class and its header file just includes the <code>CATDeclareClass</code>
    macro:
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>#include &quot;CATNotification.h&quot;
class AlarmRinging : public CATNotification
{
  CATDeclareClass;
};</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>and its source file includes the <code>CATImplementClass</code> macro:</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>#include &quot;AlarmRinging.h&quot;
CATImplementClass(AlarmRinging,
                  Implementation,
                  CATBaseUnknown,
                  CATNull);</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>These macros are required to make a CAA V5 component from this class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Now we need to code the <code>BeginRinging</code> method which publishes
    this notification:
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>void ApartmentAlarm::BeginRinging()
{
  printf(&quot;Alarm begins to ring!\n&quot;);
  AlarmRinging * RingingNotification = new AlarmRinging();
  GetDefaultCallbackManager(this)-&gt;DispatchCallbacks
             (RingingNotification, this);
  delete RingingNotification;
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The <code>GetDefaultCallbackManager</code> methods returns the callback
    manager attached as an extension to the CATBaseUnknown class from which the
    ApartmentAlarm class derives. This callback manager publishes the
    notification thanks to the <code>DispatchCallbacks</code> method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The apartment alarm and the alarm ringing notification are ready to use.
    We create now the subscriber: the AdvisedBurglar class, which must derive
    from the CATBaseUnknown class, and include a method to call back when the
    alarm ringing notification is published, here the <code>RunAway</code>
    method.
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>#include &quot;CATEventSubscriber.h&quot;
#include &quot;ApartmentAlarm.h&quot;

class AdvisedBurglar : public CATBaseUnknown
{
  public:
    AdvisedBurglar();
    virtual ~AdvisedBurglar();
    void RunAway(CATCallbackEvent   iAlarmEvent,
                 void             * iAlarm,
                 CATNotification  * iAlarmNotification,
                 CATSubscriberData  iBurglarData,
                 CATCallback        iCallbackId);
};</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The <code>CATEventSubscriber.h</code> file is included to get the <code>AddCallback</code>
    global function signature.</p>
    <p>The <code>RunAway</code> method signature is the one of any callback
    method. Let's detail its parameters:
    <ul>
      <li><code>iAlarmEvent</code> is the event that happens. Since we do not
        define any event, but only a notification, it will be passed to NULL</li>
      <li><code>iAlarm</code> is the publisher object, that is the
        ApartmentAlarm instance</li>
      <li><code>iAlarmNotification</code> is the published notification, that is
        the RingingNotification instance</li>
      <li><code>iBurglarData</code> is data that the advised burglar could
        request to execute the callback. It is set to NULL here</li>
      <li><code>iCallbackId</code> is the identifier of the callback: it is a
        long integer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This <code>RunAway</code> method is called by the <code>DispatchCallbacks</code>
    method we have inserted in the third step. Its body could be as follows:</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>void AdvisedBurglar::RunAway(
            CATCallbackEvent   iAlarmEvent,
            void             * iAlarm,
            CATNotification  * iAlarmNotification,
            CATSubscriberData  iBurglarData,
            CATCallback        iCallbackId)
{
  ApartmentAlarm * RingingAlarm;
  RingingAlarm = (ApartmentAlarm *) iAlarm;

  printf(&quot;AdvisedBurglar: I RUN AWAY!!\n&quot;);
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>The advised burglar should now, to be fully advised, set the callback.
    Otherwise the <code>RunAway</code> method would never be called. To set this
    callback, we add the method <code>ComeNearTheApartment</code> and the <code>_Alarm</code>
    data member to the AdvisedBurglar class. The callback itself is set using
    the <code>AddCallback</code> global function:
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>void AdvisedBurglar::ComeNearTheApartment(
             ApartmentAlarm *iAlarm)
{
  _Alarm = iAlarm;              // Record the alarm
  AddCallback(this,             // Set the callback
              _Alarm,
              AlarmRinging::ClassName(),
              (CATSubscriberMethod)&amp;AdvisedBurglar::RunAway,
              NULL);
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>To be more fully advised, the callback should be removed when it is
    unused. Imagine a burglar that could hear the alarm of all the apartments he
    tried to visit when they ring! To remove a callback, our advised burglar
    uses the <code>RemoveCallback</code> method in the <code>RunAway</code>
    method (new statements are shown in bold typeface):
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>void AdvisedBurglar::RunAway(
            CATCallbackEvent   iAlarmEvent,
            void             * iAlarm,
            CATNotification  * iAlarmNotification,
            CATSubscriberData  iBurglarData,
            CATCallback        iCallbackId)
{
  ApartmentAlarm * RingingAlarm;
  RingingAlarm = (ApartmentAlarm *) iAlarm;
  <strong>RemoveCallback(this, RingingAlarm, iCallbackId);</strong>

  printf(&quot;AdvisedBurglar: I RUN AWAY!!\n&quot;);
  <strong>_Alarm=NULL;</strong>
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>It could be also advisable to remove, or not to set the callback if it is
    already set. The <code>ComeNearTheApartment</code> method is modified as
    follows (new statements are shown in bold typeface):</p>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>void AdvisedBurglar::ComeNearTheApartment(
               ApartmentAlarm *iAlarm)
{
  <strong>if ( ! iAlarm ) return;</strong>    // No alarm
  <strong>if ( _Alarm ) </strong>             // I know an alarm
  <strong>{</strong>
// This alarm is different from the current one
    <strong>if ( _Alarm != iAlarm )</strong>
    {
     // remove all the callbacks I have set on that alarm
     <strong>RemoveSubscriberCallbacks(this, _Alarm);</strong>
    <strong>}</strong>
// This alarm is the same than the current one
    <strong>else</strong>
<strong>      return</strong>; // nothing to do: callback already set
  <strong>}</strong>
  _Alarm = iAlarm;             // Record the alarm
  AddCallback(this,            // Set the callback
              _Alarm, AlarmRinging::ClassName(),
              (CATSubscriberMethod)&amp;AdvisedBurglar::RunAway,
              NULL);
  printf(&quot;Burglar subscribes to the apartment alarm\n&quot;);
}</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The <code>RemoveSubscriberCallbacks</code> method removes all the
    callbacks set for a given couple of event subscriber, here the advised
    burglar, and event publisher, here the apartment alarm. Another method, <code>RemoveCallbacksOn</code>,
    is more selective, since it remove all the callbacks for a given couple of
    event subscriber and event publisher, but for a given notification and for a
    given CATSubscriberData instance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A simple program to make these objects run could be:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;AdvisedBurglar.h&quot;
#include &quot;ApartmentAlarm.h&quot;

main()
{
  ApartmentAlarm    * Alarm;
  AdvisedBurglar    * Burglar;

  Alarm = new ApartmentAlarm();
  printf(&quot;Alarm created\n&quot;);

  Burglar = new AdvisedBurglar();
  printf(&quot;Burglar created\n&quot;);

  Burglar-&gt;ComeNearTheApartment(Alarm);
  printf(&quot;Burglar comes near the apartment\n&quot;);

  Alarm-&gt;BeginRinging();
  exit(0);
  return 0;
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This program creates the following output:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>Alarm created
Burglar created
Burglar comes near the apartment
Alarm begins to ring!
AdvisedBurglar: I RUN AWAY!!</pre>

<h4><a name="400000"></a>Deriving from CATEventSubscriber</h4>
<p>Another way of publishing events or subscribing to events is to derive the
publisher or the subscriber, or both, from the CATEventSubscriber class. They
can coexist with publishers and subscribers which derive from the CATBaseUnknown
class.</p>
<p>Such publishers and subscribers have the same capabilities as if they derive
from the CATBaseUnknown class, but since publishing and subscribing methods are
their own methods instead of global functions, and since a publisher aggregates
its callback manager, other objects can request them to publish or subscribe.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let's modify our advised burglar example as follows. We
simply add a controlled door that the burglar attempts to open without the key,
and this attempt publishes an attempt opening notification to which the alarm
subscribes, and rings whenever this notification is published. To code this, we
add a ControlledDoor class which derives from the CATEventSubscriber class, and
thus includes a callback manager. This illustrates the publisher. To also
illustrate the subscriber, we make the AdvisedBurglar class also derive from the
CATEventSubscriber class instead of CATBaseUnknown.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysCallback2.gif" alt="CAASysCallback2.gif (9755 bytes)" width="814" height="433"></p>
<p>Below is the ControlledDoor class header file:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATEventSubscriber.h&quot;
#include &quot;AttemptOpening.h&quot;

class ControlledDoor : public CATEventSubscriber
{
  CATDeclareClass;
  public:
    ControlledDoor();
    virtual ~ControlledDoor();
};

CATImplementClass(ControlledDoor, Implementation,
                  CATBaseUnknown, CATNull);

ControlledDoor::ControlledDoor() { }
ControlledDoor::~ControlledDoor() { }</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The AttemptOpening notification class is like the previous AlarmRinging
notification class:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATNotification.h&quot;
class AttemptOpening : public CATNotification
{
  CATDeclareClass;
};

CATImplementClass(AttemptOpening, Implementation,
                  CATBaseUnknown, CATNull);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The AdvisedBurglar class constructor has an additional argument: the door
instance, to store it as a data member. The <code>AttemptToOpenDoorWithoutKey</code>
method is added to the AdvisedBurglar class to simulate the burglar behavior
attempting opening the door. This method requests the door to publish an
AttemptOpening notification class instance. This is made possible because the
ControlledDoor class derives from the CATEventSubscriber class, the <code>DispatchCallbacks</code>
method being a member function and not a global function can be called for that
ControlledDoor instance. In the same way, the <code>AddCallback</code> method
being also a member function instead of the global function, its signature
changes by loosing its first parameter:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
  AddCallback(_Alarm, AlarmRinging::ClassName(),
              (CATSubscriberMethod)&amp;AdvisedBurglar::RunAway,
             NULL);
...

void AdvisedBurglar::AttemptToOpenDoorWithoutKey()
{
  printf(&quot;Burglar attempts to open the door\n&quot;);
  AttemptOpening * Attempt = new AttemptOpening();
  printf(&quot;Door dispatches notification AttemptOpening\n&quot;); // Burglar requests
  _Door-&gt;GetCallbackManager()-&gt;                          // door to publish
           DispatchCallbacks(Attempt, _Door);              // opening attempt
  delete Attempt;                                          // event
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><img src="../CAAIcons/images/warning.gif" alt="warning.gif (206 bytes)" width="30" height="30">
The <code>RemoveCallback</code> method is also a member function, and looses its
first parameter. Nevertheless, if you want to use the global functions, use the
scope resolution operator <code>::</code> with the appropriate signature, such
as for <code>AddCallback</code>:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>::AddCallback(Subscriber,

<p>CAA V5 has the following classes to handle the callback mechanism:</p>
<p><img src="images/CAASysCallback3.gif" alt="CAASysCallback3.gif (5941 bytes)" width="611" height="333"></p>
<p>The CATEventSubcriber class accommodates both the event publisher and the
event subscriber. The pointer to the CATCallbackManager instance is used only if
the object is an event publisher. Note that the CATCommand class derives from
the CATEventSubscriber class, and thus all the objects that inherit from the
CATCommand class are potential event publishers and subscribers. Events are
usually designed as CATNotifcation instances, nevertheless the parameter <code>CATCallbackEvent</code>
exists as a typedef for a char *.</p>
<p>A subscriber subscribes to a publisher for a given event by means of the <code>AddCallback</code>
method which also specifies the method to call, and revokes its subscription by
means of the <code>RemoveCallback</code> method.</p>
<p>A publisher declares the event to publish, or instantiate the notification to
publish, and delegates to its callback manager by means of the <code>DispatchCallbacks</code>
method the job of calling the subscriber registered method for each subscriber
it manages in its subscriber's list for that event or notification.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="500000"></a>Other Types of Callbacks</h3>
<p>Interactive applications can set callbacks on a command in the following
cases:
<ul>
  <li>They return in the main loop: OnIdle callbacks</li>
  <li>After a given time: TimeOut callbacks</li>
  <li>A given file descriptor is modified: File Descriptor callbacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>When such an event occurs, the application calls the command concerned on the
method declared when setting the callback.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="510000"></a>OnIdle Callbacks</h4>
<p>You can set OnIdle callbacks to do specific tasks whenever the application is
waiting, for example for user input. Below is the header file of a very simple
application that sets such a callback:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATInteractiveApplication.h&quot;

class MyApplication : public CATInteractiveApplication
{
  public :
    MyApplication();
    virtual ~MyApplication();
    virtual void BeginApplication();
    virtual int  EndApplication();
};
static void OnIdleCallbackMethod();          // static method</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Look at the source file below. The BeginApplication method sets an OnIdle
callback. The <code>OnIdleCallbackMethod</code> method is requested to be called
whenever the application returns in the event main loop. Since this application
does nothing, it is always in the event loop, and we set a counter by means of
the stop variable, which is incremented each time the callback method is called,
and we stop to play when stop reaches the value 10.</p>
<table class="code">

<h4><a name="520000"></a>TimeOut Callbacks</h4>
<p>You can also set TimeOut callbacks, that is callbacks triggered after a given
time elapsed. We keep the previous example, and we add a command, as a data
member of the application, which sets a TimeOut callback in its constructor, and
which is then called when this time is over.</p>
<p>The command header file is as follows</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATCommand.h&quot;

class MyCATCommand : public CATCommand
{
  public :
    MyCATCommand(CATApplication *Father);
   ~MyCATCommand();
    static void MyStaticMethod();
    static int End;
};</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The command <code>MyStaticMethod</code> static method is called by the
callback set in the command constructor when 100 milliseconds elapsed:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CATApplication.h&quot;
#include &quot;MyCATCommand.h&quot;

int MyCATCommand::End = 0;
MyCATCommand::MyCATCommand(CATApplication * Father)
         :CATCommand (Father)
{
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;MyCommand sets a timeout callback&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;  // Call
  Father-&gt;AddTimeOut( 100,(CATCommand*)this,NULL,                // MyStaticMethod
                (void (*)()) MyCATCommand::MyStaticMethod);         // after 100ms
}

MyCATCommand::~MyCATCommand()
{}

void MyCATCommand::MyStaticMethod()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;MyStaticMethod is running&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  End = 1;
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>OnIdleCallbackMethod</code> is modified to make the application
exit when the TimeOut callback is called, that is when it has set <code>End</code>
to 1.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>void OnIdleCallbackMethod()
{
  cout &lt;&lt;&quot;In the OnIdle callback method - End = &quot; &lt;&lt;

  if ( MyCATCommand::End == 1 ) {

<h4><a name="530000"></a>File Descriptor Callbacks</h4>
<p>You can also set callbacks when file descriptors are modified. This applies
generally to any entity homogeneous to a file, such as an input flow, a pipe, a
socket, but not to disk files. The term file descriptor applies to UNIX and
corresponds to file handle with Window.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>The callback mechanism enables publish/subscribe between objects. Any object
can publish events, and any object can subscribe to events published by any
other object. The publisher delegates to its callback manager the job of calling
the subscriber on their requested methods, and the management of the subscriber
list.</p>
<p>Objects can also subscribe to system events using onidle, timeout, and file
descriptor callbacks.</p>

<h3><a name="000000"></a>What Is a Component?</h3>
<p>Components are the atoms that build an application. A component is a piece of
executable code that you can't modify, but that you can use by means of the
interfaces it exposes, that hides its implementation details, that can be
replaced, even at run time, by another component exposing the same interfaces
and performing the same job, and that ensures upward compatibility to client
applications using it.</p>
<p>Compared to many past and often present monolithic applications, CATIA
offers, since 1988 and its Version 3, an application programming interface that
enables you to create applications, such as IUA commands, GII interactive
functions, and batch applications. Since 1992 and CATIA Version 4, the same
openness happens with data, and you can add your own application data to the
CATIA data. Even if CATIA itself was a monolithic application, the applications
and the data you added match partially the component definition, since you can
reuse your applications on newer CATIA releases without the need of rebuilding
them, and your application data without migrating it.</p>
<p>With the help of the object-oriented technology, data and software make a
whole named object, and components are now made of objects. Objects provide the
features required by components:
<ul>
  <li>Objects can expose their interfaces and hide their implementations</li>
  <li>Objects can be exchanged at run time with other objects that match the
    same interface, even if they are provided by object servers located
    elsewhere on the network, providing component modularity</li>
  <li>New versions of objects with new capabilities can be provided while
    keeping client applications running without the need of rebuilding them,
    providing component scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll see in this article what is a CAA V5 component made up of, how you can
create them as CAA V5 component providers, and how you can use and extend them
as client application programmers.</p>

<h3><a name="010000"></a>What Is a CAA V5 Component?</h3>
<p>Client application programmers have usually a logical view of CAA V5
components and see a CAA V5 component as an object exposing interfaces. On the
opposite, the component supplier has a detailed physical view of the CAA V5
component, that is, he/she knows which C++ classes make up the component, how
these C++ classes are assembled to build the component, and which interface is
implemented by which class.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="LogicalView"></a>The Client Application Programmer Logical View</h4>
<p>As a client application programmer, you often need to create components and
manipulate them using the interfaces they expose, whatever the way and the
complexity of their internal structure. For example, when you need to create a
circle, you call the circle component factory which creates a circle instance
and returns a pointer to the CATICircle interface. Then you need to move the
circle, and you call QueryInterface to get a pointer to the CATIMove interface
for this circle component instance. Then you may need to draw it, or modify its
display attributes. Whenever you need to do something to this circle, you ask
for a pointer to the appropriate interface if you haven't one already, and you
use this pointer to call the methods exposed by this interface for this
component.</p>

<p>Your view of the component you manipulate is a logical view that makes you
see the component as if it were simple and self-contained.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="PhysicalView"></a>The Component Supplier Physical View</h4>
<p>As a component supplier, your view of the component may be quite different.
You may want to take advantage of the code factorization capabilities offered by
CAA V5, and make full use of extensions. This makes it possible for you to
design and code a single application component like a circle as several C++
classes, one being the circle main implementation class, and the others
extension classes of this main implementation class, each of these classes
implementing one or several interfaces through which the client application
programmer will manipulate the circle, seeing it as a simple and single
component.</p>
<p>For example, the classes making up the circle could be designed as shown on <a href="#Fig2">Fig
2</a>.</p>
<table width="100%">

    Classes</caption>

    <td align="center"><img border="0" src="images/CAASysComponent2.gif" width="582" height="499"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>According to this design, up to four classes can be instantiated when the
client application programmer manipulates a circle, but everything happens as if
only one component were manipulated.</p>

<h3><a name="100000"></a>What Is an Extension</h3>
<p>The CAA V5 object model modularity and scalability is offered through
extensions. This is a very powerful means to build CAA V5 components from C++
objects and to supply software updates without implying to rebuild the client
applications.</p>
<p>An extension to a main implementation class is a separate class that is
attached to the main implementation class and which extends it to implement
additional interfaces that this main implementation class does not implement
itself. Extension common usage is to share the implementation of interfaces
between several components, or to implement a new interface which did not exist
at the time the framework was released and which was added after. This helps a
lot for modularity and scalability.</p>
<p>Extensions are C++ classes which must have the <code>CATBaseUnknown</code>
class among its base class, and that must directly OM-derive from <code>CATBaseUnknown</code>.
They can be of the following types:
<ul>
  <li>Data extensions, if they contain data members and methods</li>
  <li>Code extensions, if they contain only methods and no data member.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extension class and the class it is an extension of are declared in the
extension source file using the macro <code>CATImplementClass</code>. The link
between the extension and the interface it implements is managed through the
dictionary. The shared library which contains the code for the extension is also
included.</p>
<p>The class that implement interfaces as an extension of a component is created
automatically when a pointer to an interface the extension implements is
requested by <code>QueryInterface</code>. So you don't need to worry about a
factory of global function to create extensions.</p>
<p>Note that the extension is not a recursive concept. There are no extensions
of extensions.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="200000"></a>Data Extensions</h4>
<p>A data extension is a C++ class that contains data members and methods.
Suppose that our object MyObject is already used by numerous clients and that we
want to add data that it doesn't hold already. If we supply a new version of our
object which implements an additional interface for this data, the clients will
be very happy to get a new functionality, but may become unhappy when we'll tell
them to rebuild their applications, even if they don't use this interface. To
overcome this problem, we can use a data extension as follows:</p>
<table width="100%">
  <caption><a name="Fig3"></a>Fig 3: A Component Made up of an Implentation and
    a Data Extension Classes</caption>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img border="0" src="images/CAASysDataExtension.gif" width="497" height="333"></td>
</table>
<p>The new interface CATIData is implemented by the separate C++ class
MyDataExtension with methods to access the data and data members to store it.
There is no need to rebuild the client applications when you deliver the data
extension, since the MyObject class has not changed from these applications
standpoint. Only client applications that want to take advantage of the update
need of course to be modified and rebuilt.</p>
<p><b>Lifecycle</b>: A call to <code>QueryInterface</code> against the object
for an interface implemented by a data extension of this object creates the data
extension instance, or uses the existing one. The data extension is deleted only
when the object of which it is an extension is also deleted, that is when all
the reference counts of the object and of all its extensions reach 0.</p>
<p>The idl file for CATIData is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>// IDL encoded interface

#pragma ID CATIData &quot;DEC:7db286f1-218d-0000-0280020a86000000&quot;
interface CATIData : CATBaseUnknown {
#pragma PROPERTY Length
  HRESULT get_Length(out int oLength);
  HRESULT put_Length(in int iLength);
};</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The resulting header file <code>CATIData.h</code> is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>// C++ generated interface class header file
#include &quot;CATBaseUnknown.h&quot;
extern IID IID_CATIData;
class CATIData : CATBaseUnknown {
  CATDeclareInterface;
  public :
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall get_Length(int * oLength) = 0;
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall set_Length(int iLength) = 0;
};</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The resulting source file <code>CATIData.cpp</code> is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>// C++ generated interface class source file
#include &quot;CATIData.h&quot;
IID IID_CATIData = { 0x7db286f1, 0x218d, 0x0000,
    {0x02, 0x80, 0x02, 0x0a, 0x86, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00} };
CATImplementInterface(CATIData, CATBaseUnknown);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The MyDataExtension class implements this interface:</p>
<table class="code">

      <pre>#include &quot;CATBaseUnknown.h&quot;

class MyDataExtension : public CATBaseUnknown {
  CATDeclareClass;
  public :
    MyDataExtension();
    virtual ~MyDataExtension();
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall get_Length(int * oLength);
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall set_Length(int iLength);
  private :
    int _Length;
};</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The CAAEDataExtension class source file is as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>#include &quot;CAAEDataExtension.h&quot;

CATImplementClass(CAAEDataExtension, // Extension class name
                  DataExtension,     // Data extension
                  CATBaseUnknown,    // Always OM-derive extensions from CATBaseUnknown
                  MyObject);         // Main class of the extended component

#include &quot;TIE_CATIData.h&quot;
TIE_CATIData(CAAEDataExtension);

CAAEDataExtension::CAAEDataExtension() {}
CAAEDataExtension::~CAAEDataExtension() {} 

HRESULT CAAEDataExtension::get_Length(int * oLength)
{ oLength = _Length; return S_OK; }

HRESULT CAAEDataExtension::set_Length(int iLength)
{ _Length = iLength; return S_OK; }</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>CATImplementClass</code> macro states that the class
CAAEDataExtensionis a data extension and that extends the MyObject class. The
third argument that declares the component from which the current one OM-derives
makes sense only for component main classes and must always be set to <i>CATBaseUnknown</i>
with an extension.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="300000"></a>Code Extensions</h4>
<p>A code extension is an extension that contains only methods, and no data. At
run-time, for a given code extension, only one instance of this code extension
exists, whatever the number of existing objects this code extension extends.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CAASysCodeExtension.gif" width="449" height="315"></p>
<p>As for data extensions, there is no need to rebuild client applications when
the code extension is supplied.</p>
<p>You code a code extension as a data extension, and just use <code>CodeExtension</code>
instead of <code>DataExtension</code> as the second parameter of the <code>CATImplementClass</code>
macro in the code extension class source file, as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
CATImplementClass(CAAECodeExtension,
                  CodeExtension,
                  CATBaseUnknown,
                  MyObject);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Lifecycle</b>: Once created for a given object instance, the code
extension is never deleted and is used for all the instances of the same object.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="500000"></a>Sharing Extensions</h3>
<p>Sharing an extension makes several classes implement the interfaces the
extension itself implements, and not only one class as shown in the above
sections about extensions. This is another step in code factorization and
reusability, and in code scalability.</p>
<p>There are two ways for sharing extensions. The first way is to let the
extension itself declare of which classes it is an extension. This is very handy
if you have existing classes for which you want to add an additional behavior by
means of the interfaces implemented in the extension. You don't need to rebuild
the existing classes, just supply the extension. The second way is to declare
the extension support in the classes that are extended by the extension. This is
very handy if you have an existing extension and if you want to declare it as an
extension of new classes. You don't need to rebuild the extension, just supply
the new classes.</p>
<p>Declare that an extension class is an extension for several classes in the
extension class source file (.cpp) as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CATBeginImplementClass(MyExtensionClassName,    // Begin declaration
                       DataExtension,
                       CATBaseUnknown,
                       TheFirstClassIExtend);
CATAddClassExtension(TheSecondClassIExtend);
CATAddClassExtension(TheThirdClassIExtend);
...
CATAddClassExtension(TheLastClassIExtend);
CATEndImplementClass(MyExtensionClassName);     // End declaration</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>CATBeginImplementClass</code> macro replaces the <code>CATImplementClass</code>
macro. The <code>CATAddClassExtension</code> macro is used to add a class to the
extended classes, and the <code>CATEndImplementClass</code> macro ends the
declaration sequence for the concerned extension.</p>
<p>You declare an existing extension in a new class in this class source file
(.cpp) as follows:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CATSupportImplementation(ExtensionClassName,
                         MyClassName,
                         ImplementedInterface);</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>CATSupportImplementation</code> macro allows addition of existing
extensions incrementally to new classes.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="600000"></a>What Are the TIE and the BOA?</h3>
<p>In the code example above, when implementing <i>CATIData</i>, the following
lines were used:</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>...
CATImplementClass(CAAEDataExtension, // Extension class name
                  DataExtension,     // Data extension
                  CATBaseUnknown,    // Base component - Always OM-derive TIE extensions from CATBaseUnknown
                  MyObject);         // Implementation class of the extended component

#include &quot;TIE_CATIData.h&quot;
TIE_CATIData(CAAEDataExtension);
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Let's detail them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>CATImplementClass</code> macro is used in conjunction with the <code>CATDeclareClass</code>
    macro in the class header file to express that the class is part of a CAA V5
    Object Modeler component. Its arguments read as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>The class name</li>
      <li>The CAA V5 Object Modeler class type. Valid values are <code>Implementation</code>,
        <code>DataExtension</code>, and <code>CodeExtension</code></li>
      <li>The name of the main class from which the component OM-derives. This
        is valid for:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Implementation</code> type classes</li>
          <li><code>DataExtension</code> type classes that implement one
            interface using the BOA</li>
        </ul>
        This is NOT valid for:
        <ul>
          <li><code>DataExtension</code> type classes that implement all their
            interfaces using TIEs</li>
          <li><code>CodeExtension</code> type classes</li>
        </ul>
        In these two last cases, this argument should be set to either
        CATBaseUnknown or CATNull.
      <li>The name of the extended component if the class is an extension, or
        CATNull if the class is an implementation</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The include of the TIE_CATIData.h header file generated from the
    TIE_CATIData.tsrc file created when the <i>CATIData</i> interface was
    created. This file contains the <code>TIE_CATIData</code> macro code</li>
  <li>The call to this <code>TIE_CATIData</code> macro that actually creates the
    code for the TIE class. The macro parameter is the name of the class that
    implements the interface. The TIE class is instantiated and a pointer to it
    is returned by <code>QueryInterface</code> when the component is asked for <i>CATIData</i>.
    The TIE is an intermediate class that ties the client application and the
    component at run time without any link at build time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TIE is the technology promoted by CAA V5 to handle interfaces at run
time. Nevertheless, in some scenarios where performance is critical,
instantiating an intermediate object may be costly. For example, if a component
is instantiated thousands of times and if a pointer to a given interface is
requested against each component instance, thousands of TIE objects are created
and may lead to memory allocation problems. To avoid this, CAA V5 proposes an
alternate solution: the BOA.</p>
<p>BOA stands for Basic Object Adapter. The BOA technology makes <code>QueryInterface</code>
return a pointer to the class that implements the interface rather than a
pointer to an intermediate class. The BOA saves a class instance per component
in scenarios such as the one described above. Even if a pointer to the
implementing class is returned, it is returned as an interface pointer, and
there is not more coupling between interface and implementation than with the
TIE. The client application does not know which class implements the interface,
has no build time link with its header file or module, and can thus only call
the methods exposed by this interface.</p>
<p>To implement <i>CATIData</i> using the BOA instead of the TIE:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Derive the extension class from the interface. The header file is thus
    changed:<br>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>#include &quot;<b>CATIData.h</b>&quot;

class MyDataExtension : public <b>CATIData</b> {
  CATDeclareClass;
  public :
    MyDataExtension();
    virtual ~MyDataExtension();
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall get_Length(int * oLength);
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall set_Length(int iLength);
  private :
    int _Length;
};</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Use the <code>CATImplementClass</code> and the <code>CATImplementBOA</code>
    macros.<br>
    <table class="code">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre>...
CATImplementClass(CAAEDataExtension, // Extension class name
                  DataExtension,     // Data extension
                  <b>CATIData</b>,          // Always OM-derive BOA extensions from the BOA implemented interface
                  MyObject);         // Implementation class of the extended component

<b>CATImplementBOA(CATIData, CAAEDataExtension);</b>
...</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    With respect to a TIE implementation, the following is changed:
    <ul>
      <li>The third argument of <code>CATImplementClass</code> must be set to
        the implemented interface from which the extension class derives</li>
      <li>The <code>CATImplementBOA</code> macro replaces the <code>TIE_CATIData</code>
        macro. Its arguments are the BOA-implemented interface and the extension
        class name respectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that since the class implementing the interface using the BOA must
derive from the interface, and that CAA V5 does not support multi-inheritance, a
given class can BOA-implement only one interface, the others being
TIE-implemented. So carefully choose the appropriate interface to BOA-implement
if your class implements several interfaces. In addition, BOA is not available
with <code>CodeExtension</code> type classes.</p>
<p>CAA V5 BOA candidate interfaces are the <b>U4</b> and <b>U5</b> labelled
interfaces [<a href="#References">3</a>], that is, the interfaces you implement
and that V5 calls onto your components. U4 means that you implement the
interface by deriving a V5 supplied adapter class and override a part of the
methods. U5 means that you write the code for all the methods of the interface.
While there is no BOA restriction with U5 interfaces, pay attention with U4
interfaces. A U4 interface must be BOA-enabled, that is, its adapter must derive
from it, otherwise BOA cannot be used for that interface. Among the U4
interfaces, some are BOA-enabled, and some are not. To know whether a U4
interface is BOA-enabled, check <b>BOA information</b> section in the interface
documentation.</p>

<h3><a name="InShort"></a>In Short</h3>
<p>A component is an object that implements interfaces. It is seen as a single
object from the component user standpoint, but can be implemented as several C++
objects.</p>
<p>An extension is an object that is part of a component to provide it a given
behavior by implementing one or several interfaces. The extension is not seen
from the client application, but is handled using a pointer to an interface it
implements. An extension is also the means to add behavior to a component
without modifying already existing client applications.</p>
<p>The TIE and the BOA are the CAA V5 technologies to implement interfaces. A
class can implement many interfaces using the TIE, but only one of them can be
implemented using the BOA.</p>

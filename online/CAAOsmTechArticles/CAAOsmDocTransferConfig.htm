<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Documents are often transferred between clients and sub-contractors. But how
are the features managed in the retrieved document when the application code and feature catalog do not accompany this transfer? This article intends to
answer this question by analyzing a number of common basic behaviors on features
created &quot;from scratch&quot; as well as on features derived from other
existing features when the application code and catalog are available as
compared to when they are not available.</p>

<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview of Basic CATIA Behaviors&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The basic CATIA behaviors analyzed in this article are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>The display of the feature in the specification tree</b>: This behavior
    is managed by the <i>CATINavigateObject</i> interface. This interface is
    implemented on all natively-defined CATIA features, i.e., features defined in
    applications provided by Dassault Systemes. Its methods return the name of the
    feature and a list of its children. If a new client-defined feature is created in
    the document, it must implement the <i>CATINavigateObject</i> interface
    in order to correctly appear in the specification tree. When a feature is
    added to the specification tree under an existing node, that parent node
    must be capable of listing it as its child. The feature itself
    must be capable of listing any of the features it may eventually be pointing
    to.</li>
  <li><b>The visualization of the feature's geometry: </b>This behavior is
    managed by any C++ interface deriving from <i>CATIVisu</i>: <i>CATI3DGeoVisu</i>,
    <i>CATI2DGeoVisu</i>, etc. One of these interfaces is implemented on all
    natively-defined CATIA features, i.e., features defined in applications
    provided by Dassault Systemes. It must be implemented on any feature having
    a geometry that can be visualized in order to be taken into account during
    the visualization process.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>The edition of the feature: </b>This behavior is managed by the <i>CATIEdit</i>
    interface. This interface must be implemented on any feature for which one wants to
    display a specific panel allowing the edition of the feature's attribute
    values.</li>
  <li><b>The update of the feature: </b>This behavior is managed by the <i>CATIBuild</i>
    interface. This interface must be implemented on any feature that is meant to be
    integrated in the update process. This interface allows the re-calculation
    of a feature's result based on the results of other features.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>The Cut/Copy/Paste and Delete operations enabled on the feature: </b>This behavior
    is managed by the <i>CATICutAndPastable</i>  and <i>LifeCycleObject</i>
    interfaces. These interfaces are
    implemented on all selectable CATIA features and their re-implementation is dependent on
    any specific actions that must be performed during a CCP operation on the
    client-defined feature. They, therefore, do not need to be systematically
    re-implemented. However, in order to enable CCP operations, the <i>CATICSOFilter</i>
    interface (or its equivalent, depending on the application) must be implemented on the
    client-defined feature. This
    implementation is only possible if the application's <code>UIActive</code> object has delegated
    the authorization to the document's features.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the technical article entitled &quot;Integrating New Features in CATIA&quot; [<a href="#References">1</a>] for a view of the
different interfaces needed to be implemented in order for new client-defined features to be correctly integrated in CATIA.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="FromScratch"></a>Working with Features Defined
&quot;From Scratch&quot;</font></b>
</p>
<p><font size="3">A feature that is created &quot;from scratch&quot; is
completely client-defined: it does not inherit any behaviors or attributes from
any other existing feature.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Here is an explanation of what enables each behavior described
in the previous section to be taken into account for a feature created &quot;from
scratch&quot;:</font></p>
<p><b>The display of the feature in the specification tree</b>: The application
code managing the feature must have implemented the <i>CATINavigateObject </i>interface
on the feature in order to display the feature's name and its children in the
navigation tree. If the application code is present, the feature will appear in
the navigation tree; if not, the feature will not be seen at all. The catalog containing the feature's StartUp
may also be necessary for this behavior to be correctly implemented because the
feature's StartUp may point to other features that would be part of the
navigation process, whereas this information may not be present on the feature
instance itself.</p>
<p><b>The visualization of the feature's geometry. </b>The application code
managing the feature must have implemented the <i>CATI3DGeoVisu</i> (or
equivalent) interface on the feature in order to take the feature into account
during the visualization process. If the application code is present, the
feature will, therefore, be correctly visualized; otherwise, it will not be
visualized at all. The catalog containing the
feature's StartUp may also be necessary for this behavior to be correctly
implemented because the feature's StartUp may contain attribute values that are
not necessarily present on the feature instance itself.</p>
<p><b>The edition of the feature. </b>The application code managing the feature
must have implemented the <i>CATIEdit</i> interface on the feature in order to
display a specific panel allowing the feature's attribute values to be
modified. If the application code is present, the feature is selectable and this panel will be
displayed; otherwise, the feature will not even be selectable and no panel will
be displayed. If the catalog containing the feature's StartUp is not available, the
panel may be incomplete: indeed, some of the feature's attributes can only be
found on the StartUp.</p>
<p><b>The update of the feature. </b>The application code managing the feature
must have implemented the <i>CATIBuild</i> interface on the feature in order to
allow its re-calculation in the event any dependent results have been modified.
If the application code is present, the feature will be correctly re-built,
otherwise, it will not be taken into consideration during the update process. The catalog containing the
feature's StartUp may also be necessary for this behavior to be correctly
implemented because the feature's StartUp may contain attribute values that are
necessary to the build process but that are
not necessarily present on the feature instance itself.</p>
<p><b>The Cut/Copy/Paste and Delete operations enabled on the feature. </b>If the
application code managing the feature is present, then the feature is already
selectable both by its geometry and its entry in the specification tree. If the <i>CATICSOFilter</i>
interface has been implemented on the feature, then it can be included in CCP
and Delete operations. The catalog containing the feature's StartUp is not necessary for
this behavior to be correctly implemented.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="DerivedFeatures"></a>Working with Derived Features</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">A &quot;derived feature&quot; has been created by the derivation
of another existing feature. It has inherited the behaviors and attributes of
the deriving feature. In this article, the &quot;deriving feature&quot; is
considered to be a feature provided by one of the native CATIA applications. The
receiving client or sub-contractor installation is assumed to contain the
deriving feature's native CATIA application and catalog.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Here is an explanation of what enables each behavior
considered in this document to be taken into account for a &quot;derived
feature&quot;.</font></p>
<p><b>The display of the feature in the specification tree</b>: The application
code managing the feature may have implemented the <i>CATINavigateObject </i>interface
on the feature in order to display the feature's name and its children in the
navigation tree. If it did not or if the application code is not present, the
feature may still appear in the navigation tree, but its particular name may not
be correct and its list of children may not be complete. The catalog containing the feature's StartUp
may also be
necessary for this behavior to be correctly implemented because the feature's
StartUp may point to other features that would be part of the navigation
procedure, whereas this information may not be present on the feature instance
itself.</p>
<p><b>The visualization of the feature's geometry. </b>The application code
managing the feature may have implemented the <i>CATI3DGeoVisu</i> (or
equivalent) interface on the feature in order to take the feature into account
during the visualization process. If it did not or if the application code is
not present, the feature may still be visualized, but the visualization may not
be complete. The catalog containing the
feature's StartUp may also be necessary for this behavior to be correctly
implemented because the feature StartUp may contain attribute values that are
not necessarily present on the feature instance itself.</p>
<p><b>The edition of the feature. </b>The application code managing the feature
may have implemented the <i>CATIEdit</i> interface on the feature in order to
display a specific panel allowing the feature's attribute values can be
modified. If it did not or if the application code is not present, this panel
will not be displayed. If the application code is present but the catalog
containing the feature's StartUp is not available, the panel may still not be
displayed.</p>
<p><b>The update of the feature. </b>The application code managing the feature
may have implemented the <i>CATIBuild</i> interface on the feature in order to
allow its re-calculation in the event any dependent results have been modified.
If it did not or if the application code is not present, the feature will not re-built. The catalog containing the
feature's StartUp may also be necessary for this behavior to be correctly
implemented because the feature's StartUp may contain attribute values that are
necessary to the build process but that are
not necessarily present on the feature instance itself.</p>
<p><b>The Cut/Copy/Paste and Delete operations enabled on the feature. </b>Even
if the
application code managing the feature is not present, it is possible that the
feature can still be selectable. However, it is necessary for the <i>CATICSOFilter</i>
and <i>CATICcpAble</i> interfaces to have been implemented on the feature itself
in order to allow CCP and Delete operations. The application must, therefore, be
present in order for this behavior to be enabled.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Summary"></a>Summary</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The tables below summarize the different behaviors available
for features created &quot;from scratch&quot; and for those that have been
&quot;derived&quot; as accessed by the receiver of the document. Only the two
following possibilities are taken into account in the receiver's configuration:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font size="3">Both application and catalog are available&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Neither application nor catalog are available</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3">The two other possibilities,&nbsp;</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="3">Only the application is available, the catalog is not</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Only the catalog is available, the application is not</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3">are not considered because, in the first case,&nbsp; the
result of this configuration is too dependent on the specific application
itself, and in the second case, the existence of a catalog without the
application does not contribute to any different result as compared to the case
where there is neither application nor catalog.&nbsp;</font></p>

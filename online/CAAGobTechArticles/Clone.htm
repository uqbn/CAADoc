      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>The copy and paste of geometric objects that takes into account their
      forward linked objects, is called <strong>cloning</strong>. This process
      is supported by the <strong>CATCloneManager</strong> class. Moreover, the
      geometric objects can also be <b>moved</b>, with or without copy, through
      a specific process handled by the <strong>CATTransfoManager</strong>
      class. Why these classes are needed, how they are used and how a geometric
      object and a manager cooperate are the main topics of this paper.

<h3><a name="An operator to copy an object"></a>Operators to Copy or Move
Objects</h3>
<p>CATCloneManager is a class representing an operator that manages the copy and
paste of a set of objects implementing the CATICGMObject interface, that is to
say the persistent objects provided by the CGM offering. This operation, that
also takes into account the forward linked object, is called a <strong>cloning</strong>,
and is especially useful to design your own cut, copy, paste applications.</p>
<p>Why is there a specific class for this process, instead of a method in each
class of each geometric object? This could be the easiest way to do when the
objects to clone are isolated, that is, have no links with other objects. But
take now two curves C1 and C2 laying on the same surface. You want to globally
copy the set of the three objects C1, C2 and the underlying surface. If the copy
process was at the geometric object level, the surface would be twice copied,
and the resulting objects would not represent an exact image of the global
initial set.</p>
<p>To prevent from this kind of configuration, the cloning process has a global
knowledge of the objects to clone. Therefore, the role of the <strong>CATCloneManager</strong>
is to federate the way to copy and paste objects and their forward linked
objects. In particular, the manager clones a list of selected objects, without
unnecessarily duplicating the forward common linked objects.</p>
<p>The same frame occurs for the transformation of geometric objects
implementing the CATGeometry interface. For these objects that have a geometric
meaning, the geometric transformation process follows the same way than the
clone process. Hence, an object implementing the CATGeometry interface, which is
a kind of CATICGMObject interface, will be geometrically transformed, with or
without duplication, by the mean of a <strong>CATTransfoManager</strong>
instance, which is a kind of CATCloneManager instance.</p>

<h3><a name="The CATCloneManager"></a>The CATCloneManager</h3>
<p>The programmer gives to the CATCloneManager the objects to be cloned
together, by calling the <tt>CATCloneManager::Add</tt> method. All the objects
must belong to the same container (a container is an object containing other
objects) to be processed in a single operation.</p>
<p>The copy and paste is not made at the creation of the clone process, or when
objects are added to the list to copy, but triggered by the <tt>CATCloneManager:Run</tt>
method.</p>
<p>After the run, you can retrieve the cloned object corresponding to each
object of the input list.</p>
<p>If there are topological objects to clone (topological objects are kind of
geometric objects), the CATCloneManager creates, under request, the topological
journal associated with the cloning operation.</p>
<p>The CATCloneManager instances are transient, and therefore cannot be
streamed.</p>

<h4><a name="Properties"></a>Two Modes of Cloning</h4>
<p>The cloning process can be done as a single copy or a full copy. This mode is
ruled by the <strong>CATCloneManagerType:</strong>
<ol>
  <dl>
    <dt><tt>CatCGMSingleDuplicate</tt></dt>
    <dd>Only copies and pastes the objects that are <tt>Add</tt>ed to the
      CATCloneManager. This is only available if the objects are copied from and
      pasted in the same container</dd>
    <dt><tt>CatCGMFullDuplicate</tt></dt>
    <dd>Copies and pastes the objects that are <tt>Add</tt>ed to the
      CATCloneManager and their forward linked objects.</dd>
  </dl>
  <table>

      CATCloneManagerType</caption>

        <p align="center"><img src="images/Clone2.gif" alt="Clone2.gif (7989 bytes)" width="479" height="359"></td>
      <td valign="middle">These diagrams show the behavior of the

        <p>When C2 is selected in SingleDuplicate, its copy C2_c lays on
        Surface. In FullDuplicate, Surface is also duplicated in Surface_c</p>
        <p>When C1 and C2 are selected in SingleDuplicate, their copies C1_c and
        C2_c respectively lay on Surface. In FullDuplicate, their copies lay on
        Surface_c, the copy of Surface, that has been duplicated <em>only once</em>.</td>

<h4><a name="A code sample"></a>A Code Sample</h4>
<p>The following example illustrates how to copy the two curves C1 and C1 of the
previous section and paste them into an other container. The result will be two
new curves laying on the same new surface, with the same characteristics as the
initial one.</p>
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>CATCloneManager MyManager(GeoFactoryForPasting); // the CATGeoFactory is also a container
MyManager.Add(C1);   
MyManager.Add(C2);
// Copies C1 and C2 and paste them in GeoFactoryForPasting
MyManager.Run();  
// Retrieves the copy of C1  
CATICGMObject* ClonedObject=MyManager.ReadImage(C1);</pre>

<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="How a CATICGMObject and a CATCloneManager cooperate"></a>How a
CATICGMObject and a CATCloneManager Cooperate</h4>
<p>The CATCloneManager globally manages the cloning, but delegates the copy of a
single object to each object.
<ol>
  <li>The CATCloneManager asks the object to clone itself through the <tt>CATICGMObject::Clone</tt>
    method.</li>
  <li>The object to clone asks back the CATCloneManager for the copy of its
    forward linked objects through the <tt>CATCloneManager::ComputeImage</tt>
    method.
    <ul>
      <li>If the copy of the forward linked object has already been created
        during the cloning process, it is directly returned</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the process re-runs at the step 1 for the linked object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, there are two types of methods of a CATCloneManager
<ul>
  <li>&quot;user methods&quot;, that you call to clone CATICGMObjects, as in the
    <a href="#A code sample">code sample</a> :
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>Add</tt></dt>
      <dd>Adds objects of the same container to the set of objects to clone</dd>
      <dt><tt>Run</tt></dt>
      <dd>Triggers the cloning process</dd>
      <dt><tt>ReadImage</tt></dt>
      <dd>Retrieves a pasted object</dd>
      <dt><tt>WriteReport</tt></dt>
      <dd>Writes topological items in the journal</dd>
      <dt><tt>GetFactory</tt></dt>
      <dd>Retrieves the factory of the pasted objects</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;object methods&quot;, to use for writing the <tt>Clone</tt> method
    of a new class of CATICGMObject . These methods are not seen by the CAA
    programmer.
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>ComputeImage</tt></dt>
      <dd>Called inside the code of a CATICGMObject.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="The CATTransfoManager"></a>The CATTransfoManager</h3>
<p>This operator is a kind of CATCloneManager, that moves CATGeometry objects,
with or without copying them. This part highlights the new properties and
behaviors with respect to those inherited from CATCloneManager.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h4><a name="Inherited properties"></a>Inherited Properties</h4>
<p>The global architecture is of course inherited. It includes:
<ul>
  <li>The cooperation between the manager ant the objects it manages</li>
  <li>The behavior of &quot;users&quot; and &quot;objects&quot; methods that
    have already been described</li>
  <li>The fact that it cannot be streamed.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="New properties"></a>New Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The first new property is obviously the transformation. The
    CATTransfoManager takes two types of transformations:
    <ul>
      <li>Linear transformations, instances of CATMathTransformation,
        representing a simple displacement of the object. These linear
        transformations must be invertible.</li>
      <li>Non linear transformations, instances of
        CATMathNonLinearTransformation, which definition depends on the point
        where the transformation is done. This is useful for describing
        deformations such as sheet metal folding and unfolding.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now, the CatCGMSingleDuplicate/FullDuplicate mode has no more meaning for
    transformations. It is replaced by the <strong>CATTransfoManagerType</strong>,
    defined as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dt><tt>CATTransfoManager::Replace</tt></dt>
    <dd><tt>T</tt>ransforms the objects that are <tt>Add</tt>ed to the
      CATransfoManager and their forward linked objects that are not
      geometrically invariant. In some cases, a copy occurs, when a pointing
      object is not in the selection. Do not use this mode for the
      transformation of topological objects, because of the smart mechanism. For
      your reminder, a topological object is a kind of geometric object with
      logical boundaries and the smart mechanism is the fact that topological
      objects to modify have first to be duplicated.</dd>
    <dt><tt>CATTransfoManager::Duplicate</tt></dt>
    <dd>Copies, transforms and pastes objects that are <tt>Add</tt>ed to the
      CATransfoManager and their forward linked objects that are not
      geometrically invariant, without unnecessarily duplicating common forward
      linked objects. In particular, a CATTransfoManager with this option and
      the identity transformation gives the same result as a CATCloneManager
      with <tt>CatCGMSingleDuplicate</tt> mode.</dd>
    <dt><tt>CATTransfoManager::FullDuplicate</tt></dt>
    <dd>Duplicates and transforms the objects that are <tt>Add</tt>ed to the
      CATTransfoManager. Duplicates a forward linked object even if it is
      geometrically invariant by the transformation,</dd>
  </dl>
</ul>
<p>The rules for the duplication of the forward linked objects in the same
container are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>If a forward linked object is geometrically <strong>invariant</strong> by
    the transformation, this object is not duplicated, except if this forward
    linked object is specifically <tt>Add</tt>ed to the CATTransfoManager.
    Invariant means that the transformation does not change the object with
    regards to its maximum limits: for example, a line is invariant by a
    transformation along its direction, a circle is invariant by a rotation
    around an axis perpendicular to its plane and passing by its center.</li>
  <li>Any forward linked object that is not geometrically invariant is copied or
    replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figures illustrate the behavior of the CATTransfoManager in
different cases:</p>
<table>

      <p>If an object that points to Surface is not in the selection (as C1),
      Surface is duplicated and moved in Surface_d. In replace mode, the other
      selected objects C2 and C3 point now to this new surface Surface_d.</p>
      <p>If all the objects pointing to Surface are selected :</p>
      <p>* In replace mode, Surface is moved: the relative position between the
      curves and Surface remains the same, and C1, C2, C3 are not touched. Note
      that in some rare cases, the curves will also be moved, because the
      parameterization of the transformed surface can change from the initial
      one. This is the case when the surface is defined from a curve or another
      surface, themselves invariant by the transformation.</p>

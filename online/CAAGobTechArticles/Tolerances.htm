     <h3>Abstract</h3>
     <p>The topology is a way to logically describe connections between objects. 
     And it may happen that the underlying geometry does not exactly join, 
     leading to gaps. This article describes how these gaps are managed, in 
     particular by the Boolean operations. </p>

 <h3><a name="Introduction"></a>General Principles</h3>
 <p>The <em>resolution</em>, defined at the level of the geometric factory you 
 are working with, is the <em>tolerance of creation</em> of the geometric 
 objects: it defines the lowest admissible length of a geometric object. Hence, 
 curves or edges of length less than the factory resolution are not created, for 
 example.</p>
 <p>But the geometric operators, such as intersection or projection, run until 
 the numerical precision, much more precise than the resolution of the factory.</p>
 <p>To stay inside the limits of the relative numerical tolerance, the 
 resolution fixes the maximum size of the model, called <em>ModelSize</em>.</p>
 <p>In another hand, the topology is a way to logically capture the design 
 intend. Hence, an edge can logically links two faces which underlying surfaces 
 are not contiguous: there is no maximum value on the gap between theses 
 surfaces, although CGM tries to avoid to create situations with large gaps.</p>
 <p>In the same manner, the sharpness criterion can be logically put on an edge. 
 The sharpness defines the tangential continuity of two edges, or the continuity 
 of the normals of two faces. This criterion is global on the edge, and 
 influences the behavior of the propagation of some topological operators (such 
 as the filleting operator). </p>
 <ul>
   <li>if the edge is said smooth, the fillet is always propagated.</li>
   <li>if the edge is said sharp, this does not say that the fillet is never 
     propagated. In fact, it may be locally smooth, and must be propagated in 
     this case. The locally smoothness is decided if the sharpness angle is less 
     than the <em>tolerance of sharpness</em> ( <tt>CATTopSharpAngle</tt>) at 
     that location.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>We first recalled how the resolution is defined, then study the behavior of 
 the Boolean operator when it encounters topologies with underlying geometry 
 that presents gaps.</p>

 <h3><a name="The Resolution of the Factory"></a>The Resolution of the Factory</h3>
 <p>The geometric factory is the object that creates any geometric objects. The 
 unit of the geometric factory is the mm.</p>
 <p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

 <h4><a name="ModelSize: the bounding box of the CGM model"></a>Model Size: the 
 Bounding Box of the CGM Model</h4>
 <p>The factory defines the maximum box inside which the geometric objects must 
 be. This box is defined by the <i>Model Size</i>, fixed by default to 1km (100m 
 before R14). All the objects must be inside the box [-1km, +1km] for CATParts 
 created after R14.</p>

 <h4><a name="Resolution: the lower valid length of an object of the CGM model">
 </a>Resolution: the Lower Valid Length of an Object of the CGM Model</h4>
 <p>The <i>Resolution</i> defines the mimimum length of a valid object. It is 
 fixed to <tt>10^-3.unit</tt>. As the unit is mm, lines of length smaller than
 <tt>1micro-m</tt> are not valid.</p>
 <p>The management of confusions (&quot;Do two objects have the same geometry?&quot;) is a 
 direct consequence of the resolution: if the distance between to geometric 
 points is less than the resolution, the two points are considered to be 
 geometrically at the same location.</p>
 <p>An other consequence of the resolution is that edges of length less than the 
 resolution cannot be created. This has a direct impact on Boolean operators for 
 example.</p>

 <h4><a name="Modification of the Unit and the Model Size"></a>Modification of 
 the Unit and the Model Size</h4>
 <p>Unit and Model Size cannot be changed by the user. When you create a 
 geometric factory, its unit is the mm and the Model Size is 10^6mm=1000m in R14 
 and after R14 and 100m before R14.</p>
 <p>However, when you open an existing geometric factory that you did not 
 create, do not suppose its unit and Model Size: recover them by the <tt>
 CATGeoFactory::GetUnit</tt>, <tt>CATGeoFactory::GetModelSize</tt> methods.</p>

 <h3><a name="How Gaps Are Taken Into Account by the Boolean Operators"></a>How 
 Gaps Are Taken Into Account by the Boolean Operators</h3>
 <p>The topology is a logical information of connections. This logical 
 information is related to geometry, which can be not exactly contiguous. But 
 CGM does not impose a maximum gap for extremities of curves to be the same 
 vertex, or to curves to be the same edge. In fact, remember that the resolution 
 is not a gap tolerance, but a creation tolerance. So that it allows you to 
 create topologies with gaps (the underlying geometry do not exactly connect 
 together), although it does not create itself gaps larger than the resolution.</p>
 <p>Let be a body, that is to say a general topological object. Imagine that 
 this body have gaps larger than the resolution, because it comes from a system 
 that allows them, for example CATIA V4. The question is to know how these gaps 
 are taken into account by the topological operators.</p>
 <p>Imagine that in this body, there is an edge that connects two faces F1 and 
 F2 with a gap larger than the resolution. A Boolean operation is asked between 
 these two faces and a third one, F3. The gap that is really important to take 
 into account is the tangential gap along the edge.</p>

     initial gap G has not been widened.
      <p>If T is greater than the resolution, a New Edge can be (and then is) 
      created, with its corresponding geometry, as a merged curve. This merged 
      curve references two curves, one on the surface of the third intersecting 
      face F3, the other being the Edge Curve of the edge between the two faces 
      F1 and F2. The initial gap has not been widened too.</td>

 <ul>
   <li>The Model Size is the maximum length of a valid object. The resolution 
     and the unit are defined at the creation of the geometric factory (<code>CATGeoFactory</code>).</li>
   <li>The model size determines the lowest length of a valid object, called the 
     resolution of the factory. The resolution is a tolerance of creation, and 
     then of confusion, but not a tolerance of gaps: You can import bodies with 
     gaps larger than the resolution, although CGM tries to avoid the creation 
     of such bodies.</li>
   <li>The topological operators take the gaps into account, and create, when 
     necessary and if needed, edges to fill them. They do not create new 
     discontinuities, so that the resulting bodies are compatible with regard to 
     their gap quality: the initial gaps are not widened.</li>
   <li>The tolerance of sharpness is a way to decide of the local sharpness 
     quality, when it is not globally defined as smooth for a given edge.</li>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This article discusses the CAAAniExport use case. This use case
      explains how to manage an Analysis document (create, open or write) and
      explore its content from the analysis specification modeler view, down to
      the physical data supported by finite element entities. This covers the
      meshing entities, pre and post-processing physical data. It is based on a
      model created by the Structural Analysis application.</p>

<h3><a name="Learn"></a>What You Will Learn With This Use Case</h3>
<p>This use case is intended to help you make your first steps in programming
with the CATIA Analysis Modeler. This means, intent is to introduce important
concepts about the underlying data structure of the analysis modeler, and ways
to navigate inside it. More specifically, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open an Analysis document</li>
  <li>Access and navigate through the analysis objects (sets) defined in the
    document</li>
  <li>Access the physical data within a set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before getting to the use case itself, it is important to have an
understanding of some of the concepts that are the heart of the Analysis
Modeler, since the use case basically navigates among objects that represent
those concepts. This is the goal of the next section. You can skip it and get
directly to the <a href="#UseCase">use case</a> itself if you are already
familiar with them.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h3><a name="concepts"></a>Some Analysis Modeler Important Concepts</h3>
<p>Before discussing the use case, some concepts of the Analysis Modeler have to
be introduced. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Analysis document structure and analysis features (sets)</li>
  <li>The analysis features and the result view. How the Spec/Result approach is
    managed inside the analysis domain (field model)</li>
  <li>The physical type definition for structural analysis</li>
  <li>The <i>CATICharacCollector</i> interface and the <i>CATAnalysisCharacCollector</i>
    class.</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts are the counterpart, on the programming side, of what the end
users see and manipulate on the screen. So we will start with the end user view
in order to understand what the program manipulates inside.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>

<h4><a name="user"></a>The End User View</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="images/StructuralAnalysisWB.jpg" width="644" height="527"></p>
<p>This is a typical CATIA V5 work session within the Structural Analysis
application. This Analysis document contains a reference to a design document
(in this case, a Part document) on which a stress analysis is computed.</p>
<p>The Links Manager role is to keep the link to the referenced design document.
It can be a Part for single part analysis, a Product for analysis of design
assemblies or other external documents.</p>
<p>The Analysis model is made of some different features. The Analysis Manager
is the root feature that allows any other feature to be managed, such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The<em> Finite Element Model,</em> dedicated to the discretization
    (meshing global and local specifications) and idealization (behavior of the
    part as physical properties). By default it contains a meshing set called
    &quot;Nodes and Elements&quot;, a material set, a property set and an axis
    set.</li>
  <li>Relative to one <i>Finite Element Model</i>, some analysis cases are
    created in order to group all kinds of external data applied to the
    idealization. (In this case, Boundaries, Loads and the solution set that
    will give access to all the physical data that can be computed by the
    solver.)</li>
  <li>The analysis case is defined for a given solver and for a specific
    computation. (In this case, static linear.) It is made of <i>analysis sets</i></li>
  <li>The analysis sets group some analysis entities, which represent some
    physical preprocessing actions applied to the design. (For this example,
    apply a <b>clamp</b> or a <b>momentum</b> to B-rep elements of the part).</li>
  <li>In order to have the result visualization, two images are in the tree. One
    to display the deformed mesh and one for the Stress VonMises Iso display.
    Associated to the second image, a color table is presented in order to
    inform about the stress variation on the structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The feature tree shows the required analysis specifications that may be used
in order to build or scan an Analysis model.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Beyond"></a>Beyond the End User View</h4>
<p>The main goal of the analysis specification modeler is to capture as much as
possible the user's design intent under the form of specifications, and to
derive from it an analysis model supported by finite element entities. This
second model is the result view of the specifications. It is called the field
model and is managed by specific objects called <b>Analysis Explicit</b>
objects.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Features"></a>Features</h5>
<p>Features embody the know-how necessary to produce an analysis model. Sets are
mainly designed in order to structure the model, by grouping entities for
consistency: the Nodes and Element set (Meshing set) groups the MESH Part
definitions, the load set groups the loading conditions (preprocessing entities)
applied on the FEM model. The Entities are made of two kinds of objects: The <b>Component</b>,
based on the Knowledge modeler, manages the numerical values of the physical
data applied to the <b>Support</b>. As of today the support can be a B-rep
element of a part, or an Assembly constraint for connection. Another goal of the
feature is to implement all the basic behaviors of CAA V5 applications
(Copy/Paste, Update, Delete, Properties, etc.).</p>
<p>Analysis features, as all features, capture essentially the design intent of
the end user. During the update step, each feature generates a finite element
model that corresponds to this intent. To do this, it relies on an underlying
modeler, the <em>Field Data Modeler</em>. This is assumed by implementing the <i>CATISamExplicitation</i><code>
</code>interface. This interface will be called by the <i>CATISamExplicit</i>
interface during the feature build. Another relation with the field model is the
behavior of these features to extract a finite element view of the data that is
defined inside it by implementing the <i>CATICharacCollector</i> interface. This
behavior allows a set to get access to physical value data that can be stored in
the field model.</p>
<p>For example, a preprocessing set will return a result view of the
preprocessing entities. This is done by combining the analysis entity values. A
solution set will be designed from a specification point if view as a feature
with a link attribute in order to locate the output solver file and will
dynamically give to the system the data values.</p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->
<h5><a name="Field"></a>Field Data Modeler</h5>
<p>This modeler is designed in order to manage data that can be understandable
by all solvers. Inside the field data model, six main kinds of objects are
defined by the following classes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <i>CATAnalysisExplicitModel</i> and <i>CATAnalysisExplicitRulesData</i>
    classes support the physical type definition, and the rules for its
    management. See [<a href="#References">1</a>] to list all physical data that
    can be managed by the Structural Analysis application.</li>
  <li>The <i>CATAnalysisExplicitSet</i> class is the image of the Feature sets.</li>
  <li>The <i>CATAnalysisExplicitEntity</i> class reflects a physical action
    applied to finite element support.</li>
  <li>The <i>CATAnalysisExplicitCharac</i> class is the physical data that
    supports the numerical values.</li>
  <li>The <i>CATAnalysisCharacCollector</i> class manages the characteristics
    obtained by combining the information of basic characteristics over several
    entities.</li>
  <li>The <i>CATICharacCollector</i> interface is dedicated to have specific
    implementations, such as a solver-dependent implementation (Automatic Output
    Acquisition). This interface has to be implemented for Analysis Feature Sets
    and Entities. In addition, a default implementation is provided for
    combining explicit entities and manage preprocessing sets and entities
    provided by CATIA applications.</li>
</ol>
<p align="right">[<a href="#Top">Top</a>]</p>
<!---------------------------------comment------------------------------------->

<h5><a name="Explicit Objects"></a>Explicit Objects as Feature Results</h5>
<p>The implementation that is done inside our application will show how the
consistency is managed between the two models. All the analysis features
implement the <i>CATIAnalysisExplicit</i> interface in order to generate the
adequate Field Model. The following image explains the link between the
specifications and the result models.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="2" src="images/Explicit.jpg" width="697" height="414"></p>
<p>For analysis sets, the <i>CATIAnalysisExplicitation</i> interface generates
an explicit set in the field model. This set can be retrieved using the <i>CATISamExplicit</i>
interface. It will manage through the CATISpecObject update schema, the update
and clean of the field model. The <i>CATAnalysisCharacCollector</i> class that
is generated by the <i>CATICharacCollector</i> interface returns the values as
they are applied or can combine them. For example, forces applied in local axes
by different features can be returned as a single vector in the global model
axis system.</p>
<p>For an analysis entity, the <i>CATIAnalysisExplicit</i> interface generates
in the field model explicit entities and characteristics, then applies the
values of the finite element entities. The CharacCollector that are generated by
the <i>CATICharacCollector</i> interface implementation will retrieve the same
kind of information by several ways.</p>
<p>This can be done for pre-processing and post-processing sets. Another way to
implement this interface can be notified. This way is mainly used for solver
results. The feature set has a link to the output file in order to retrieve it
from the model and to generate the <i>CATAnalysisCharacCollector</i> class
according to the content of the file. Also, this data can be expressed in other
positions or versions without being really stored in the field model.</p>

<p>From the user view image to:</p>
<p><img border="2" src="images/Sampleof_file.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030" width="609" height="373"></p>
<p>The goal of analysis export is to open an Analysis document and to navigate
inside its data structure that represents the concepts presented in the first
part of this article. The different steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Opening an Analysis document, whose pathname is passed as first argument
  <li>Obtaining the list of Analysis models in the document</li>
  <li>Requesting from each Analysis model the related sets</li>
  <li>Requesting the associated physical data from the field model</li>
  <li>Generating the file, whose pathname is passed as second argument.</li>

<p>This first step deals with CAA document management and uses standard
interfaces of the ObjectModelerBase framework. In brief, a session must be
created. This object manages all open documents and therefore should exist prior
to the loading of any document. The necessary include files for programming are <code>CATSessionServices
</code>and <code>CATDocumentServices</code>.</p>
<p>Then, if a program needs to have an empty <code>CATDocument</code> created in
memory instead of an existing document, you can use the following sample that
creates a <code>CATDocument</code> with a versatile type that can be

<p>The next step consists in generating a trace of the output that can be
generated by the sets. The interface used is <code>CATICharacCollector</code>.
For all preprocessing sets, a default implementation is provided by the analysis
modeler. It is built by combining the Explicit Charac Objects that are created
in the Field Model.</p>

<h4><a name="output"></a>Generating the Output File</h4>
<p>The definition of a <code>CATAnalysisCharacCollector</code> is based on a
physical type, and version expressed for a given position. A physical type is
the conversion of a string by using the <code>GetPhysicalTypeNumber </code>method
of the CATAnalysisExplicitRulesData. The position is a string. The version is
build with the following attributes:</p>

<p>This is a generic example on how to dump a CATAnalysisCharacCollector. The
life cycle of this object is managed by using the AddRef and Release methods.
Inside its constructor, the object receive an AddRef and before being deleted, a
Release is needed in order to inform that the object is no more referenced.</p>
<p>CAAAniDumpByGroup and CAAAniDumpByFEentity functions show how to extract data
associated respectively to a group definition or finite element definition. All
of these outputs are piloted by the choice of a physical type, a version and a
position. CAAAniDumpByGroup is useful for Material, Local Axis , properties and
CAAAniDumpByFEentity will be preferred for Restraints, Load, Solution Sets.</p>
